?		we love mojo ! <sssss> its not as evil of a treat and the flavors are so yummy ! <sssss> a minor downfall is how the mix-ins are sometimes hard to reach and i 've seen a girl literally put her whole head into the bar and that grossed me out with the idea others have done the same ... aka - possible human debris and hair in my yogurt !
?		this is a casual spot to eat with friends before going out into old town . <sssss> servers are hit or miss but just this last visit our server was very flexible with the menu and willing to change/add things to make us happy . <sssss> they recently added sushi to the menu which was odd to my friends since the place is a chinese restaurant . <sssss> i really did n't care and just ordered 2 rolls which were pretty good ! <sssss> the spicy tuna was `` meh '' and the crouching dragon roll was deelish ! <sssss> love edamame and the server suggested some sauce but gave it on the side `` in case '' i did n't like it - but it was really good , so glad she offered it ! <sssss> the half portions are very large so no need to order the whole size unless your sharing . <sssss> they do n't have sapporo light which kinda sucks because of the extra calories . <sssss> great open bar and cool happy hour spot .
?		best steak in town hands down ! <sssss> great crowd , live music , professional servers , wonderful menu . <sssss> the lobster mashed potatoes are a must try on the menu !! <sssss> i had one martini and could n't finish the second because the first one did enough damage : -rrb- housemade whipped cream with dessert literally made me dance in my chair . <sssss> fantastic , fun place to go on a date ~ !!
?		we went for lunch and i made the mistake of ordered the shrimp tacos and a smithwicks because i was craving them . <sssss> the fiance -lrb- yes , we 're engaged ! <sssss> -rrb- ok , so he ordered a burger and kiltlifter . <sssss> the food came and my tacos were whack -lrb- duh - i should have known better ! <sssss> -rrb- and travis 's burger was bomb . <sssss> it had a fat onion ring in it and thick cut bacon . <sssss> i ate more of his than mine . <sssss> besides all that , our server was crappy . <sssss> she never came around to ask if we wanted another round of brews ... lame . <sssss> as a pub - they should be bringing barrels to us . <sssss> the bill was $ 50.00 . <sssss> the end .
?		from beginning to the end , durants was flawless . <sssss> no windows in the place , and red booths fill the room . <sssss> a large inviting bar , and old rat pack feel from the place . <sssss> if i could afford to dine here often i would be one fat and happy girl .
?		my wife really wanted to come here . <sssss> i used to think this was the best in town , but things have changed . <sssss> it seems like every time i walk away from here my thoughts are on `` i just paid $ ... for that ! '' <sssss> it seems like prices went up and quality went down when they opened at the biltmore . <sssss> i guess they have to cover that rent with higher prices .
?		just wonderful ! <sssss> i love the coffee here . <sssss> the atmosphere is war and friendly . <sssss> a lot of friendly people hanging out .
?		these 4 stars are all based on expectations . <sssss> what do you expect when you go to greasewood flats ? <sssss> what are your expectations when you go to a bar that has mostly outdoor seating ; picnic tables ; open fire pits ; horseshoe pitches ; donkeys ; roosters ; one man band ; limited food menu ; serves only beer and sodas ; and is filled with bikers , cowboys and lesser so tourists . <sssss> this is everything that you expect from greasewood flats . <sssss> the atmosphere is so relaxed that i think you would be hard pressed to find a more caasual environment . <sssss> everyone is just having a good time hanging out with friends . <sssss> the green chile and bacon cheeseburger is a great idea , but the only way they cook the burgers is to medium . <sssss> medium is overcooked in my book and the medium that i got was actually well done . <sssss> again , it 's about expectations . <sssss> i came here to hang out with friends and family and enjoy the day .
?		the food & beverages at moto are awesome . <sssss> the service needs a little help , as they do n't always check on you to see if you need another beer or a water refill . <sssss> they might just need more staff . <sssss> i award 4 stars because i know i will be back for the beer and food . <sssss> awesome selection of craft brews on tap , only $ 3/glass during happy hour -lrb- 3pm - 6:15 pm -rrb- . <sssss> cheap appetizers during happy hour too . <sssss> win ! <sssss> numerous veggie choices -lrb- that are actually good -rrb- . <sssss> the wonton nachos minus meat were awesome . <sssss> the tofu yakisoba was awesome . <sssss> the veggie rolls were awesome . <sssss> i wish this place was closer to my house .
?		what a breath of fresh fresh air . <sssss> the owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them . <sssss> how awesome is that ? <sssss> regarding the rice , apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed . <sssss> the owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie ! <sssss> they 're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it 's delicious ! <sssss> the pitas contain no dairy , which is awesome . <sssss> this place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs . <sssss> definitely recommend that you check this place out !
?		i like the comparison to lady & the tramp that nathan s. made in his review . <sssss> this place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths . <sssss> the service at anzio 's is usually very good . <sssss> the salads are very good . <sssss> the bread is good . <sssss> the pizza and the other dishes are just ok . <sssss> the beer selection is lacking , no good micro-brews -lrb- get some sierra nevada , new belgium beers or at least some four peaks , would ya ? <sssss> -rrb- and that 's all i 've got to say about that
?		i 've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and i finally found out at my visit to scramble . <sssss> i ordered up the garlic spinach , thyme & mushroom brizza -lrb- which also comes with some type of cheese , possibly provolone -rrb- . <sssss> this thing was delish ! <sssss> my girl ordered up the ham & cheddar brizza , but she liked mine even more and proceeded to steal one of my slices . <sssss> scramble also scores extra points with me for having loose-leaf teas . <sssss> i got a cup of the gun-powder green tea mint , which was very good . <sssss> we were bummed that the hashbrowns were pre-made with bacon inside , as it made them no option for vegetarians like me . <sssss> we sat outside at their very slick & shaded outdoor patio and dining area . <sssss> cmon down , ya got ta try a breakfast pizza !
?		seeing the word `` hippies '' in the restaurant name had me stoked , as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food , right ? <sssss> yep . <sssss> i walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options , the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites . <sssss> score ! <sssss> or so i thought ... upon receiving the large , heavily stuffed burrito , i bit in with high hopes . <sssss> those hopes quickly dissipated as i found that the innards of the burrito were primarly cold . <sssss> the cactus pieces were cold , the cheese was n't melted at all . <sssss> the only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans , which were n't even hot , they were luke warm . <sssss> sorry guys , but a cold burrito is n't going to cut it . <sssss> make that cactus , beans and rice hot in your burritos if you want some customers . <sssss> melt the friggin cheese in there , do n't leave it ice cold .
?		i 'm giving castles n coasters 4 stars for their mini-golf . <sssss> four separate courses , plenty of creative greens & hazards , lots of decorations , statues , structures , fountains , everything that makes up a good miniature golf course . <sssss> oh , and did i mention they have 4 different courses ? <sssss> once your done with some tiny golf , cool off with some video games , pinball or skeeball inside their gaming area . <sssss> the rides do n't interest me , so this rating & review ignores their `` amusement park '' aspect completely .
?		alright loving hut , let 's face the facts , i love you and you love me . <sssss> your `` strategery '' of using `` love '' in your establishment name has paid off , as you have enamored me with your delicious , 100 % vegan food as well as your kind & friendly staff . <sssss> i eat here all the time . <sssss> we even get their food for parties . <sssss> vegetarians , vegans & omnivores alike will find something to enjoy at loving hut . <sssss> in particular , i can wholeheartedly recommend the `` spicy cha cha '' , a unique faux breaded shrimp dish that i have seen no where else , made with yam protein . <sssss> yes , it 's delicious & amazing . <sssss> keep on rockin on , north phoenix loving hut .
?		great food , great portions , great prices .
?		had a great happy hour there this week . <sssss> great food and drinks-highly recommend the moscow mule .
?		love the view and good food . <sssss> had the lobster carbonara as my meal with the king pao green beans . <sssss> they are both listed as sides , but make a surprisingly great pairing . <sssss> enjoy !
?		not too impressed with the food , luckily we were with great friends so we had a fun time .
?		great food and service . <sssss> only 4stars cause of outside patio furniture was horrible and prices .
?		mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm1
?		i was not impressed with the sauce . <sssss> and the beef seemed real greasy . <sssss> im use to sliced beef instead of shredded . <sssss> corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when i took it out of the wrapper . <sssss> i just wasnt impressed at all . <sssss> the people were friendly and was a clean facility .
?		my very first try of ethiopian . <sssss> went at lunch hour . <sssss> selected menu items 3 , 4 , 5 . <sssss> 1 meat and 2 vegetarian . <sssss> the food came out within a minute or 2 - so they must have some buffet line inside . <sssss> the food kind of tastes like a underspiced indian food . <sssss> i almost wish the sauce was with goat or lamb . <sssss> the service was non-existant after the food trough drop off , so we just walked up and paid . <sssss> i guess i did n't find ethiopian food that remarkable - sorry ...
?		a trendy looking restaurant and bar . <sssss> we ordered the ribs and grits , seafood chowda , pineapple-upside down cake , roasted cauliflower . <sssss> also enjoyed a few cocktails . <sssss> everything was really good - really like the blue cheese grits . <sssss> i recommend !!!
?		wanted to go to a gastropub , and ended up here . <sssss> this is a really nice place inside . <sssss> comfortable seating of all types . <sssss> a big bar . <sssss> the kitchen is wide open for all to see . <sssss> the restrooms are clean and nice , too . <sssss> we ordered ; triple fried duck fries -lrb- excellent fries -rrb- , chicken liver mousse -lrb- this was absolutely excellent - could not stop eating -rrb- , bone marrow -lrb- very good flavor -rrb- , candied pork belly -lrb- quite good -rrb- . <sssss> thoruoughly enjoyed my experience here . <sssss> the service was excellent . <sssss> also tried 3 of their tasy signature drinks ; maple glazed old fashioned , frozen ` rita , and another . <sssss> a great place to dine !
?		i have been here a few times and this most recent visit was one of the last of the season : -lrb- i love walking around here , usually the entire lot is filled up but this time around there were only a few vendors . <sssss> we managed to walk away with some amazing fresh cheese from gina 's homeade : http://www.ginashomemade.com/ . <sssss> the cheese we had was fresh and soft as a spread and had some onions and chives in it . <sssss> when i say fresh , the guy said that they had just made it the day before . <sssss> oh and he had fresh cured bacon that was cured the day before as well . <sssss> amazing . <sssss> we also bought some chocolates from a vendor again , useless me ca n't remember the name but it was awesome and he was clearly passionate about his chocolates . <sssss> he explained where he got different cocoa from and the differences in the tastes because of the region . <sssss> so cool . <sssss> we sampled some other stuff too and of course it was all great . <sssss> i wish they did n't shut down for the summer , but who can blame them . <sssss> ca n't wait til they are back up and running !
?		this was out first time bringing out first dog as a couple to a park . <sssss> we were so nervous ! <sssss> milly is a bolted and has n't quite learned her manners/cues yet so its really intimidating to bring a dog like that in a public area . <sssss> there are double doors and high fences so this was clearly thought through . <sssss> milly had a great time ! <sssss> they provide poo bags which is nice but make sure you watch your step - not all puppy parents care to pick up their poo . <sssss> they have plenty of balls and toys to play with as well as some watering spots which was fun . <sssss> i ca n't wait to bring her back here to get rid of her energy !
?		management handled my problem the way all management should handle any restaurant problem . <sssss> they were quick to respond and it was very clear they want everyone to be happy . <sssss> thank you for redeeming yourself on this and i appreciate the extra time you took to email me a few times and learn what happened . <sssss> other pita jungles and all restaurants should take note on handling these kinds of situations . <sssss> thank you !
?		convenient - close to the house and easy . <sssss> this was my first time here and it was eh . <sssss> i got the beef and broccoli - i know , not a traditional thai dish by any means , but i was in the mood . <sssss> the sauce was good and the broccoli was cooked well but the meat was too thin , dry , bland but managed to taste weird . <sssss> i ate everything but the meat and was still full so not a total loss . <sssss> my boyfriend got the pad thai and it was also only ok . <sssss> i do n't think i would return here , but i also do n't want to judge it on a one time trip .
?		this is our go to delivery pizza . <sssss> they always say it will take 45 minutes , but they are here in 30 and sometimes under . <sssss> we live very close but other places have n't delivered as fast as these guys . <sssss> we usually end up ordering on sundays when we are to lazy to cook and we always order the same thing . <sssss> they are nothing but consistent and good from the pizza to the wings . <sssss> i have had other pizza around the valley but none this good ... just genuinely good pizza and service -lrb- and ranch dressing ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		although some of the guys seemed a bit confused around lunch time , the service was great and quick . <sssss> this was my first time eating here and its great pizza with great ranch dressing . <sssss> we had pepperoni and cheese slices with a salad . <sssss> the salad was big enough to share so that was nice . <sssss> i would definitely order from here and get delivery or just go and eat here again . <sssss> they had some renovations going on during our trip there but it was still really clean and nice inside .
?		i love everything about this place and i eat at a pita jungle at least once a week . <sssss> here 's why i love this place ... first , the waitresses are all super cool and edgie . <sssss> if you 're a semi-goth chick with a couple of tattoos , midrif , belly button ring , and hot body , you ought to apply to pita jungle and go get me some hummus . <sssss> second , the hummus . <sssss> i get a hummus plate with 1/3 hummus , 1/3 babaganoosh , and 1/3 tadzhiki -lrb- my spelling stinks i 'm sure -rrb- . <sssss> this is a great appetizer and is fun to share . <sssss> third , the prices . <sssss> this place is a great bargain . <sssss> fourth the portions ... they 're huge ! <sssss> fifth , the `` garden veggie wrap '' . <sssss> okay i love meat . <sssss> but occasionally my body tells me i need some veggies . <sssss> when this occurs i go to pita jungle and order this beast . <sssss> it 's huge , it 's tasty and it 's loaded with veggies . <sssss> i figure i get a week 's worth of veggies in one sitting with this baby . <sssss> sixth , everything else . <sssss> i love everything on the menu ... the smoothies , the lavosh schwarma wrap , the pizza 's , the wine list , and the seafood provencal is an amazing portion of seafood for 10 bucks . <sssss> in closing please excuse my spelling . <sssss> i ran spell check and apparently my spelling here is so bad even spell check ca n't help me .
?		happy to stumble upon this place while looking for a munch on our way to a concert at the marquee theater . <sssss> really , really good carne asada . <sssss> we had burritos , and the trio chip platter which includes chips , salsa and guacamole . <sssss> the guac and the carne were authentic with just the right amount of kick . <sssss> you know you 're at an authentic mexican joint when they garnish your meal with a radish chunk . <sssss> the price was fine , so i 'm not sure about all the griping about being pricey . <sssss> the quality of meat makes up for being charged 50 cents more . <sssss> this place is a gem . <sssss> they have a limited menu , but what they do do is spot on delicious . <sssss> tasty to the mex , i mean max .
?		i love this place . <sssss> i 'm so glad i finally stopped in . <sssss> huge seating area . <sssss> great prices . <sssss> huge portions . <sssss> i got a gyro with feta and it was darn good . <sssss> was it the best gyro in town ? <sssss> no . <sssss> but it was very respectable . <sssss> the pita bread had a nice chewy crustiness to it . <sssss> the meat was seasoned and moist , and the toppings of tomato , onions , yogurt sauce -lrb- tetziki sp -rrb- and feta were very generous . <sssss> i love a good messy sandwich and this fit the bill . <sssss> it came was large side of fries . <sssss> a nice meal for 7 bucks . <sssss> the rest of the food all looked tasty and well-portioned . <sssss> i 'm going back for burger , then a salad , then a chicken sandwich and then a sub .
?		three things on the menu . <sssss> pizza , calzones and salads . <sssss> that 's it . <sssss> all done very well , in a great atmosphere with attentive service . <sssss> the pizza menu has no suggestions , just a list of toppings , accordingly , you have ... no meat lovers pizza . <sssss> got ta make your own . <sssss> no margharitta pizza . <sssss> you select it . <sssss> no bbq chicken pizza . <sssss> figure it out and order it . <sssss> no veggie pizza . <sssss> pick 'em yourself . <sssss> of course , the list of toppings is ample , and you can design anything you want . <sssss> we ordered a small pie with garlic and pepperoni . <sssss> also had a small salad . <sssss> -lrb- fyi the salad menu does not require that you pick your own ingredients . <sssss> -rrb- they were having some oven temperature problems , but the staff was helpful and the manager took care of the issue . <sssss> bring the whole family .
?		-lrb- keep in mind there are few choices for hawaiian style fast food in az so this might influence my review -rrb- . <sssss> i love going here when i have a craving for hawaiian food . <sssss> i usually order the bbq mix plater composed of beef , chicken and short ribs . <sssss> i also love their macaroni salad . <sssss> the portions here are quite large ; i usally eat half the plate and save the rest for later . <sssss> the people at this location are very friendly and the food is prepared quickly . <sssss> i would recommend this place if you are tired of eating at the burger/mexican chains around phoenix .
?		nice place to try a different kinda of sandwich if you 're tired of chains like subway . <sssss> i love their housemade mozzarella , local tomato & basil : food was fresh and the bread was excellent . <sssss> i also tried the tuna with red onion , gaeta olives , lemon & arugula and that was nice as well . <sssss> service/seating was really quick -lrb- went on a saturday for lunch -rrb- . <sssss> only complaint is the parking , had to park on the street a couple blocks down because their lot was packed .
?		i 've been to buffalo wild wings before , but my first visit at this location was during ufc 117 . <sssss> if you come here to watch fighting events like ufc i would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside . <sssss> i arrived an hour before the ppv portion of the fight started and did n't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside . <sssss> i ordered 12 regular wings and i was very underwhelmed . <sssss> i felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average . <sssss> the main reason why i went here was that they were n't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight . <sssss> also , the atmosphere for a ufc fight was really good compared to the other bww i went to in tucson . <sssss> if you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event , you should come to bww . <sssss> but your food expectations should be lowered a lot .
?		i would go there much more if i was closer . <sssss> always find very interesting items . <sssss> like it when they sample the food . <sssss> i got hooked with the lasagna and have been buying it ever since . <sssss> this store as with other trader joes can get super busy later in the evening .
?		i have tried a couple other vietnamese food restaurants and think tea lite has the freshest ingredients and best overall flavor . <sssss> # 1 or # 3 depending if i want more beef or spring rolls . <sssss> the pork ball sandwich is also tasty . <sssss> the soups are great when it is cooler . <sssss> pasadena on them in summer . <sssss> i usually go there for lunch . <sssss> it can get crowded at 12pm so you may want to try earlier or a little later .
?		easy to find what you are looking for . <sssss> parking lot is big . <sssss> it is nice and clean . <sssss> fyi . <sssss> i do n't shop here for the gas .
?		it would get 5 stars if sandbar patrons did not take all the parking spots . <sssss> that is very annoying !! <sssss> last night i could not find a place to park , so i went to albertsons to purchase my alcohol . <sssss> take notice total wine , you are losing customers !
?		one word ... chicken tikka masala ! <sssss> ok ... it 's one word if you say it like i do . <sssss> i like to say it fast so i can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part . <sssss> this place is awesome . <sssss> i ordered samosas , garlic naan , mixed grill -lrb- tandoori oven cooked variety of meats -rrb- and chickentikkamasala * giggle * . <sssss> the mixed grill was good , but the naan and the masala was the highlight . <sssss> i had to slap the hubby 's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing ... ok ... by ` slap ' i mean i may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork , pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance ... we 're so playful . <sssss> disclaimer : * no hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before , during , or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from i.d.p. . <sssss> the improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional ... the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual .
?		this place is fantastic ! <sssss> customer service was great and the prices are very reasonable . <sssss> we kinda wandered our way into the chinese cultural center on a lazy sunday afternoon , i needed to pick up a couple of things from the market , and have been craving some genuinely delicious chinese food -lrb- i was experiencing bad nerves exacerbated by systemic and repeated bouts of disappointment with my takeout and delivery options -rrb- ... anywho ... we got allllllll sorts of kerfluffled and twitterpated when we saw they had a dim sum section on the menu ... not very many dim sum options , but all of them sounded pretty good to me -lrb- plus it was the first time i actually saw a dim sum menu , usually i just see folks wandering around with carts of unknown treasures and delights ... no carts on the day we went there though -rrb- . <sssss> the menu itself is gigantic , huge , colossal -lrb- ok , not in a cheesecake factory way , but definitely more than you 'll find at a hole-in-the-wall quick order-by-numbers place -lrb- ie # 1 w / chicken and # 27 w / shrimp -rrb- -rrb- ... and is broken down into americanized and non . <sssss> i love that . <sssss> it gives me an opportunity to get something that i 'm familiar with and try some more risque items that i ca n't get from panda express . <sssss> ; -rrb- so here 's the dish : *** wonton in spicy & sour sauce -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - heavenly **** dumpling in chili sauce -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - even better than the wontons ** dan dan noodle -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - it was ok , but the other two were way better ***** sauteed green bean - phenomenal and second only to ... ***** yuxiang eggplant -lrb- this was so good that if someone told me i had to eat this eggplant and those green beans every day for the rest of my life , i would thank them ... and maybe offer my eternal gratitude -rrb- . <sssss> all of that came to about $ 30 , we were stuffed and had leftovers for my lunch the next day . <sssss> also , i went to their website -lrb- just now -rrb- and it looks like you can order takeout -lrb- phoenix -rrb- or takeout and delivery -lrb- chandler -rrb- from them online . <sssss> solid !!!
?		o. m. f ` ing . <sssss> gee ! <sssss> it was so good , and delivery was so fast ... like faster than freaky fast ... it was like roadrunner fast ... or speedy gonzales ` andale andale arriba arriba yee haw yee haw ' rapido , or like ` chip , i 'm gon na come at you like a spider monkey ! ' <sssss> fast ... and just as quickly , it was gone . <sssss> to be honest , i do n't even think the italian beef sandwich , drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese , even knew what hit it . <sssss> one moment , it 's all safe , warm & cozy in its pot , skillet , oven ... wherever italian beef comes from , then bam ! <sssss> it 's whisked off on a whirlwind adventure , delivered and not even 10 minutes later swimming in tummy acid . <sssss> happy tummy acid . <sssss> to be frank -lrb- because i guess i already used ` to be honest ' -rrb- , i have enjoyed other tamales w / chili and cheese a * skosh * better -lrb- not bad , but not the best ever -rrb- , but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked -lrb- plus they have pink lemonade and deliver , and that always makes working tygers happy -rrb- . <sssss> lots of delicious sounding stuff on the menu , i 'm looking forward to trying the chicago dog and the buffalo bleu fries . <sssss> one note to the delivery driver/to-go order specialists/management : when delivering a giant mess of a sandwich , make sure to also include napkins , fork and knife . <sssss> maybe even some of those moist towelettes they give to bbq revelers . <sssss> while clinton and lewinski may think it 's cute to have a little mess on a dress , the people i work with do not appreciate it . <sssss> * * just kidding , no dresses were harmed during the scarfing down of this meal . <sssss> *
?		it 's ok , and the prices are ok . <sssss> but the only things that i have consistently liked here are the irish car bombs , the giant pretzels -lrb- ... mmmm sodiyummy ... -lrb- sodium + yummy ... you know ? <sssss> -rrb- and beer-cheesy ! <sssss> -rrb- and the servers are more-or-less on the ball 100 % of the time . <sssss> anywho , i know they 've been going through a couple of staffing issues with their cook -lrb- s -rrb- so i will refrain from being too bummed out on the food ... plus it was a monday night so i 'll give 'em the benefit of the doubt . <sssss> we ordered the foley 's sampler , the chicken fingers were awesome , the wings were really decent too , but i could 've done without any of the rest of it . <sssss> next time i 'll see about ordering some traditional irish fare and make a real assessment . <sssss> yes , i 'll be back . <sssss> but i 'm not making any other excuses for y ' all , dammit .
?		i know artists * in general * totally hate when you compare their new stuff to their old stuff ... but here goes ! <sssss> i absolutely loved sens. . <sssss> . <sssss> and fate . <sssss> sochu house is n't quite there for me . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the food was creative and delicious . <sssss> the drink menu may still need a little work . <sssss> and drinks are kinda the most important part of the meal , right ? <sssss> we had the chicken lollipops , sugar cane pork , sweet soya , pad thai and the spring rolls . <sssss> nothing on the drink menu really grabbed me so we had the bartenderess mix up a couple of surprises . <sssss> it was ... ok . <sssss> not fabulous , just ok . <sssss> i agree with the other reviews that say the location at the strip mall is a little bizarre . <sssss> i enjoy finding strip mall dining treasures , but i can honestly say that i never would 've thought about putting sochu house there . <sssss> i love the music and they did a great job with decorating the space though . <sssss> get the sugar cane pork , do n't forget to chew on the sugar cane for a little extra flavor .
?		okay ... so i 've read thru some of the reviews . <sssss> i remember when it used to be paco paco -lrb- also a fun-spot -rrb- , but that was in my past-life experience , and it bears not-a-lot of resemblance to the place it used to be . <sssss> and i 'm not complaining . <sssss> yes , the music is pretty frickin badass -lrb- we went on saturday but i do n't believe it was an obscura night -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm a punk rock girl -lrb- do n't let the current wave of office-inspired playwear fool you -rrb- and i enjoyed their ecclectic music mix of 80 's subversive occasionally poppy songs ... the drinks are good and well - -lrb- well meaning decent , not well meaning bottom-shelf bar -rrb- - priced . <sssss> it 's nicely dark and murky ... unless you sit by the door , which is what we did at first ... hey ! <sssss> we were trying to pace ourselves -lrb- that did n't really work , i think i sucked back 4 jack and cokes in 30 minutes , do n't judge me , i had a rough day ! <sssss> -rrb- 4 drinks ... under $ 25 . <sssss> you have won my loyalty . <sssss> -lrb- so what , i 'm easy -rrb- so during that first 30 minutes , i was my counter-characteristically -lrb- read : sober -rrb- delightfully demure and polite self ... by minute 45 i was back to normal and having a grand old time , making friends , making enemies , trying to make friends out of aforementioned enemies ... you know , whatever . <sssss> anyone who said that alcohol is n't the answer was not asking the same questions i asked that night . <sssss> and i absolutely love the conglomeration of off-beat characters that came through the door . <sssss> this dive bar kicks patooty . <sssss> i like it . <sssss> i like it alot .
?		scrumptious ! <sssss> after going with my friend to see ` get him to the greek ' -lrb- it was a theme day ! <sssss> -rrb- we went to cyprus grill for lunch . <sssss> i ordered the spartan sandwich -lrb- which is grilled chicken and gyro meat -lrb- presumably lamb , but possibly cow , lol -rrb- on a pita and a side of greek fries -lrb- which are their fries with crumbled feta and maybe a lemon type sauce -rrb- ... well , whatever is on those fries , it should be illegal ! <sssss> i rarely enjoy fries and i ate every single last one on my plate ! <sssss> the portions are big and i will probably be eating my pita sandwich for another two days . <sssss> i highly recommend this place , it 's super tasty ! <sssss> -lrb- and the service was uber-fast ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		yummmmmmmy !!! <sssss> we went here for lunch today and ordered the edamame -lrb- appetizer -rrb- , firecracker chicken and broccoli w / jasmine rice and the gluten-free jeweled beef . <sssss> everything was fantastic and our server , alicea , was awesome . <sssss> the service was fast , friendly and we had a great time . <sssss> -lrb- also , they have happy hour from like 11am to 6pm ! <sssss> -rrb- too bad we ca n't take advantage of that extended happy hour , but some day * shaking my fist at ` the man ' * midday drinking will become an acceptable work phenomenon again . <sssss> * giggle *
?		midweek ... do n't wan na cook ... do n't wan na drive ... who delivers ?? <sssss> corleone 's !! <sssss> the delivery person was a sweetheart which is the equivalent of having a pleasant waiter/waitress to start your meal experience . <sssss> it sets the mood and expectations and well ... it was yummy ! <sssss> if you order the cheese fries , make sure you eat those first since cheez wiz has a limited time frame for being fresh and hot . <sssss> once it chills , you end up with ... well ... goop . <sssss> i love their cheesesteak sandwiches , this time the fries were a little overdone but still not too bad . <sssss> for a $ 20 we ordered a couple of cheesesteak sandwiches and split a cheese fry , just enough food and it does n't break the bank . <sssss> not bad for delivery !
?		ever since my bf recently discovered frozen yogurt -lrb- yeah , he 's a little slow to jump on the bandwagon -rrb- , we 've been trying different yogurt places around town . <sssss> i usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals , so thank goodness it 's lower in fat ! <sssss> i 'm 5 ' 6 '' and trying to keep up with a 6 ' 2 '' man 's metabolism here . <sssss> yogurtland has been our favorite . <sssss> they have an excellent selection with a wide variety of flavors and toppings . <sssss> we tried a bunch of flavors and both ended up doing a strawberry/cheesecake mix with strawberries , blueberries , and walnuts on top . <sssss> we also added a few of their little cheese cake bites . <sssss> their yogurt 's taste and texture is perfect . <sssss> when the cashier rang us up , we thought she had only totalled one of our yogurts by accident ... could it be only $ 6 for two pretty fully loaded cups of yogurt ?? <sssss> normally , one yogurt runs us $ 5-6 . <sssss> not only is it good , it 's cheap too ?! <sssss> that gets my stamp of approval .
?		pane bianco is a great place to take out of towners . <sssss> my sister was visiting from chilly boston last weekend , so i was determined keep her outdoors in this beautiful weather as much as possible . <sssss> after roaming the downtown phoenix farmer 's market , we enjoyed lunch at pane bianco . <sssss> pb is sandwiched between a cafe -lrb- with amazing-looking baked goods -rrb- and a bike shop . <sssss> the seating is outdoors on communal picnic tables . <sssss> they keep their menu simple , offering just a few sandwiches and salads . <sssss> the food items continue the theme of simplicity ... they use very high quality ingredients , so a lot of toppings are n't necessary . <sssss> i had fresh mozarella , basil , and proscuitto ... so good ! <sssss> and the bread , oh the bread ! <sssss> delicious !
?		what a drive , but what a nice was to spend an early afternoon ! <sssss> i had a groupon to use , so a friend and i hiked south mountain and then went over to the farm for lunch . <sssss> we stood in line raving over all the delicious food items displayed around us ... bottles of balsamic vinegars and spreads , salads with an array of brightly colored vegetables , personal homemade fruit pies ... i could go on for a while . <sssss> i decided on the turkey curry sandwich and a glass of lemonade . <sssss> the sandwich was a-mazing ! <sssss> the lemonade was fresh squeezed and tart and yummy . <sssss> bonus : they offer free tea and lemonade refills until 3pm . <sssss> we sat outside at a little table covered with a checkered table cloth and a potted flower centerpiece . <sssss> the weather was perfect and we enjoyed people watching -lrb- lots of babies and dogs at the farm -rrb- . <sssss> after a leisurely lunch , we strolled around the grounds -lrb- plentiful picnic tables and grassy areas for kids to run around -rrb- and over to maya 's farm area -lrb- where most of the ingredients are grown -rrb- ... so awesome to see where my food came from ! <sssss> the farm is a really enjoyable experience and a great place for locavores to visit . <sssss> i recommend it !
?		i 'm pretty anti-chain , but yard house has avoided my chain restaurant black-list . <sssss> they have a wide variety of food and beers on their menu . <sssss> i had been with friends several times and had n't found any dish that stood out , then i went with one friend who suggested the turkey burger ... jackpot ! <sssss> turkey burgers can sometimes be kind of bland wannabe burgers . <sssss> not this one at yard house . <sssss> it 's seasoned really well and comes with a delicious roasted tomato , melty mozzarella cheese and garlic aioli . <sssss> i do n't even particularly like tomatoes or mayonaise-based products , but this burger is delicious ! <sssss> yard house has a little something for everyone on their drink menu . <sssss> they serve lindeman 's framboise -lrb- a total girly-beer -rrb- , somewhat of a rare find at restaurants , so it 's a special treat to go have a glass .
?		my boyfriend and i went to district before a concert at the us airways center . <sssss> perfect location for a downtown event , plus they will validate your valet parking . <sssss> we went in time for their happy hour -lrb- which ends a 7pm -rrb- and sat at one of the bar tables . <sssss> very cool ambiance . <sssss> we had a great server who made helpful suggestions and guided us through the array of menu options . <sssss> i tried their red wine sangria -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- - it was a beautiful magenta color and was one of the better sangrias i 'd had in a long time . <sssss> i also had their pineapple lavender cocktail -lrb- not on happy hour - $ 10 -rrb- which is very tart and lemon-y . <sssss> not for everyone , but i loved it ! <sssss> they hand-make their drinks with fresh fruit -lrb- so they take a little while -rrb- and use fresh herbs grown on their rooftop garden . <sssss> my boyfriend picked the food and we indulged ! <sssss> all the appetizers were $ 4 -lrb- except for the nachos which were $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> the pretzel bite fondue included three pretzels definitely larger than a bite , maybe 3 or 4 bite-size . <sssss> the cheese was warm and melty . <sssss> good dish . <sssss> we also had the macaroni & cheese w / schreiner 's beer hots . <sssss> i think this one was our least favorite of all the dishes we ordered . <sssss> not that it was bad , it just did n't stand out . <sssss> a take on mac & cheese with cut up hotdog . <sssss> the nachos were topped with all the good stuff you 'd expect to find on nachos : gooey cheese , pico de gallo , guac , sour cream , and steak . <sssss> the chips were a little thicker , so they did n't break and get soggy . <sssss> finally , we had the buffalo sloppy joe sliders . <sssss> great flavor , would definitely get these again . <sssss> i 'm not in downtown phoenix very often , but district will definitely be at the top of my list next time i attend an event in the area .
?		i 've been in tanzy for drinks -lrb- they definitely have some good ones , but the one i remembered was the ginger sangria - memorable in a bad way . <sssss> it tasted like patchouli or as my boyfriend put it `` this tastes like a hippie '' -rrb- . <sssss> anyways , i had always been curious about the food . <sssss> a couple weeks ago we decided to go in for brunch and caught some of the football games at the bar -lrb- a perfect compromise ... football/bar for the boyfriend , nice atmosphere and good food for the lady -rrb- . <sssss> our friendly bartender handed us their brunch menu and said he would come back to explain their brunch buffet . <sssss> i looked at the menu and thought , what ??? <sssss> this is ridiculous ! <sssss> $ 20 for a standard eggs benedict ??? <sssss> turns out you can get the brunch only for $ 14 or you can get a dish + the brunch for the advertised price of that dish . <sssss> this also includes bottomless mimosas -lrb- their fresh squeezed oj was awesome -rrb- . <sssss> the buffet has charcuteries , cheeses , hummus , fruit , a variety of pastries and bagels , and a pancake station with at least 10 topping/filling options . <sssss> i was craving savory , so i ordered the omelet and my boyfriend got the breakfast club sandwich . <sssss> both were really good , but so filling i did n't need a lot from the buffet . <sssss> to summarize my experience , tanzy is a beautiful restaurant , has good food and friendly service . <sssss> and $ 14-20 for brunch with bottomless mimosas ... not too bad .
?		a nice selection of yogurt and toppings . <sssss> i usually get the tart yogurt with fruit on top , but they have a variety of other good flavors . <sssss> reasonable pricing -lrb- mid-level compared to other yogurt places -rrb- . <sssss> i 've always had friendly service . <sssss> good product , service , selection , and price ... yogurt builderz gets my vote .
?		some of our food was good , some was eh . <sssss> my boyfriend and i went to stax for lunch last friday . <sssss> neither of us had been there and we wanted a place with patio seating . <sssss> we started looking at the menu and matt said he was going to order two burgers ... he explained that the burgers are slider-sized after seeing the the `` what a pig ! '' <sssss> look on my face . <sssss> so we each ordered two mini-burgers , shared an order of tater tots , and split a pbj sandwich for dessert . <sssss> regular burger : good , solid standard burger bison burger : topped with an onion ring and peach bbq sauce . <sssss> pretty tasty . <sssss> i tend to like bison since it 's a little more lean . <sssss> turkey burger : sounded way better than it was . <sssss> very bland . <sssss> would not recommend . <sssss> tater tots : crunchy on the outside , soft on the inside . <sssss> ordered their spicy dipping sauce for $ 0.50 extra , but the regular old ketchup was better . <sssss> pbj : we shared their peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dessert . <sssss> it had almonds and banana in it too . <sssss> it was almost too sugary-sweet , but it was so small we only had one bite each , so it was a good little `` dessert '' to satisfy my sweet tooth . <sssss> overall , i might head back if i 'm in the area and craving a burger , but nothing outstanding compared to other great burger joints in town .
?		i heard from a friend that renegade had become their favorite dinner hangout spot , so i moved it to the top of my `` to try '' list . <sssss> i went to dinner famished after a 9 mile run . <sssss> i was ready to eat and eating is exactly what i did . <sssss> at our server 's suggestion we got the green chile pork stew ... and that first bite was so amazing . <sssss> the pork and cheese and green chile sauce with a hint of broth spooned into tortillas was heaven . <sssss> we also shared a spinach salad - candied pecans , bacon pieces , and an egg on top . <sssss> enjoyable . <sssss> we shared entrees . <sssss> i had the filet with their green peppercorn sauce and a side of green chili mac and cheese . <sssss> i knew i 'd love the mac and cheese from having it at roaring fork . <sssss> the filet was cooked perfectly and paired very well with the green peppercorn sauce -lrb- though it was neither green nor peppery -rrb- . <sssss> bf got the pork with the mushroom sauce -lrb- i liked the peppercorn sauce better -rrb- and the kale and bacon -lrb- in retrospect , i 'm noticing we kind of went crazy on the pork products that night -rrb- . <sssss> kale is definitely an acquired taste - i really enjoy it . <sssss> my boyfriend did n't like his first bite at all , but by the end of the meal was talking about what a big fan of kale he is . <sssss> the pork serving was enormous and for me , it was n't anything over-the-top special . <sssss> i 'd probably try something else next time . <sssss> we tried both their margaritas , both were okay . <sssss> we also had a couple good glasses of wine -lrb- a cab and a malbec blend -rrb- . <sssss> we did some really good eatin ' at renegade ... it was one of those indulgent meals where i had a hard time getting up and moving around afterward . <sssss> the service was very attentive and enjoyed sitting on the patio . <sssss> overall , excellent experience !
?		a true owner operated gem in scottsdale all because razz knows and cares . <sssss> he is an amazing chef who is fearless and cooks and entertains seamlessly throughout the evening . <sssss> his food is wonderful and complex with many layers of flavors and ingredients you will often not find elsewhere . <sssss> he loves food and wine and his place reflects this . <sssss> the best and only tip i can give you is to sit that the bar -lrb- chef 's table -rrb- and do the tastings meal . <sssss> he will bring out small plates one after the other until you are full . <sssss> of if you are like me , till bursting ! <sssss> the last time i dined there with a group i asked razz for a pinot noir recommendation and he steered us toward the cheapest in his lot . <sssss> he was correct in that it was an amazing wine but this goes to show his style , honestly and integrity . <sssss> his food is the same way . <sssss> if you are into art he has an amazing selection . <sssss> you could have fun just walking about the place . <sssss> the atmosphere is great and it usually has just the right amount of people there . <sssss> everyone seems to know razz . <sssss> great place , great chef . <sssss> thanks razz !
?		what happened to this place ? <sssss> it used to be one of my favorite places and now the food has gone way down hill . <sssss> worse , our family has gotten food poisoning the last two times they ate there so it is no more for us . <sssss> what a shame this place used to be amazing .
?		great food for sure but that is it . <sssss> unless you are shopping for groceries then do n't expect much of anything you would not find in a cafeteria . <sssss> yet for some reason this place just works . <sssss> the service is unusually good in a place like this and the food comes out fast and delicious . <sssss> i have had about half of the food on this menu and have never been disappointed . <sssss> come to haji 's to be full and chat with some friends over good food . <sssss> it may have you searching for more napkins but your belly will be happy .
?		i like capital grille and living in austin i had n't been in like 3 years so i was staying over by kierland and wanted a place that has great food and would n't mind my yappy puggle on their patio . <sssss> we called cg to see if they allow dogs and they do . <sssss> when we got there another person had their dog on the patio . <sssss> the server -lrb- sarah or jennifer ??? <sssss> very nice , short blond hair -rrb- was very attentive and got us some water and also our dog water . <sssss> i 'm not the type that expects restaurants to do that for our dog , he 's content to sit on the ground and have nothing , but when the restaurant and staff do make accommodations for our dog , we really really appreciate it . <sssss> that being said , they 're dog friendly ... add a 6 star for that . <sssss> the food , amazing like always , calamari was perfectly cooked and a lot of it . <sssss> the server brought a sample of a pineapple vodka drink and i liked it so i went with one of those and then also wine . <sssss> the porcini rubbed delmonico is the star of this place and it was awesome . <sssss> wife had lamb and was perfect . <sssss> so , another perfect experience for us at capital grille . <sssss> good thing we 're moving back to valley , so i can eat there more often .
?		yummy !! <sssss> pecan wood permeates the establishment . <sssss> rack of ribs : pork spare ribs , cooked so long that the bones were pliable , meat seperated from bone instantly . <sssss> joes bbq sauce is very very good and i love the habanero bbq myself pulled pork sandwich : very good and same super tender meat with same super bbq sauce ... bun was okay side mac n cheese and pit beans - both awesome the best part was the homemade root-beer . <sssss> i ca n't put in words how tastey craft root-beer is . <sssss> this tasted down home and not like coke with rootbeer syrup . <sssss> i wish they would stock birch-beer in place of the red creme soda . <sssss> birch beer i think is much more tastey than rootbeer but all in all joes is a + + to have joe 's in your neighborhood is great , good country bbq
?		since my review of texaz , i thought it would be good to review pcg kiddycorner to texaz . <sssss> picture a strip mall ... you walk in ... lights turned low , red walls , dark carpet ... intimate ... perfect ... you 've forgotten about the strip mall . <sssss> the restaurant was one of the first restaurants that i tried when i moved to az in 1998 . <sssss> thank you to my aunt marge for taking me to this little gem . <sssss> the food is what i like to call great american cuisine elevated . <sssss> pcg can , in my book call itself the most dependable dinner in the valley . <sssss> i have frequented this establishment many of times and have never had to complain about a single thing in the restaurant ... maybe when they closed for that short time back in 2000 i bitched a little . <sssss> when a restaurant puts mac n ' cheese on a menu ... they are dying to be critiqued hard ... so i use mac n ' cheese as a measure of quality . <sssss> mac n ' cheese is such a bad name because kraft and velveeta have raped it of legitamacy in the culinary world . <sssss> now pcg makes a darn creamy rich flavorful mac n ' cheese and that to me signifies attention to quality . <sssss> i have had bad mnc at other `` deconstructed '' restaurants but pcg does n't stray to far from the point of the dish ... and they are successful . <sssss> i also fancy the pot roast or the pork tenderloin . <sssss> to start i seem to always get the black bean soup and always happy i did . <sssss> great place !! <sssss> will always be included as my diamond in the rough restaurant .
?		yay , even though i miss living in coronado i am glad to be back at the melrose america 's . <sssss> if you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed i was with coronado america 's rude service that i boycotted that particular location . <sssss> now that i am back around melrose i can once again enjoy happy hour tacos and drinks , or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata . <sssss> if 7th st let you down try 7th ave.
?		let me say this up front , my wife used to work @ st. francis so we are fortunate to know the servers and staff , this always makes for a friendly environment . <sssss> i have never had any item that i did not enjoy , in fact i have a new appreciation for fresh ingredients after having the pleasure of dining here . <sssss> chef aaron can be compared to picasso with a brush , or even stephen king with a pen , except he perfects his ideas with kitchen utensils putting his work on plates . <sssss> alex , korbi and david serve great drinks . <sssss> kayla and dylan have both served us and are always attentive to their tables . <sssss> brunch is excellent , i would recommend the egg sandwich or eggs benedict , and you ca n't go wrong with any of the baked goods . <sssss> happy hour is fantastic , very good deals . <sssss> for lunch i would recommend the french onion burger , always cooked to what you order and one of the tastiest burgers i have had in the valley . <sssss> the menu is seasonal so do n't be afraid to try something new . <sssss> during your wait enjoy the building , the lines are amazing , and there is a mural from local artist dose on the second floor . <sssss> thank you st. francis .
?		the `` dillo '' is where it 's at if you want a good meal and drink . <sssss> plenty of tvs for sports and horse racing if that is your thing . <sssss> excellent sports bar , friendly staff , good food , and did i mention the drinks ?
?		if you love beer then come here . <sssss> great craft tap selection , plus they include the serving glass type . <sssss> my favorite menu item , so far , are the spam sliders . <sssss> spam you say , yes ! <sssss> give it a try , it is far different then what you may have been served as a kid . <sssss> we always stick with appetizers when coming here and have enjoyed the sausage platter , fries and gravy , and the wings . <sssss> i must admit that the only thing i have been wow 'd by were the sliders . <sssss> you definitely should give this place a shot and do yourself a favor by ordering a flight of beers to find that one you truly enjoy .
?		yeah , its that good ! <sssss> this place has a complete relaxed atmosphere . <sssss> there were several customers sitting outside with their dogs enjoying their favorite fro-yo . <sssss> if i am craving frozen yogurt next time or any type of dessert for that matter , i will be stopping by this place . <sssss> i tried the dulche leche and chocolate flavors and they were delicious !
?		we no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so . <sssss> after having to throw away the ground beef for the second time , we finally made the switch to i-mart for all our meat related purchases . <sssss> when we would ask for extra lean ground beef , we would have to pay an astronomically high price and it was still not extra lean . <sssss> it was full of fat and seems like they were mixing in lamb with it too because it stank like hell . <sssss> i was getting tired of being badly treated by the butchers who conveniently went deaf when we would ask for something -lrb- not in arabic -rrb- but would be completely on their toes helping whoever spoke in arabic exclusively with them . <sssss> one time when i asked for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter , she literally stared and me for a few seconds and moved over and started helping someone else . <sssss> i guess we are not good enough for them to help over there . <sssss> we still like the al-hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter .
?		i would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids . <sssss> this is a no frills airline . <sssss> nothing special . <sssss> there was no tv , period on our 5 hour flight from ny . <sssss> all the kids in the plane were going nuts . <sssss> the seats are very cramped and small . <sssss> the plane seemed very old . <sssss> go delta , if you have kids .
?		you can find all sorts of fresh halal meat and chicken here . <sssss> the butcher , hassan is friendly . <sssss> they prepare everything like you want it . <sssss> there is also a restaurant up front which only serves halal food called al-hana . <sssss> the beef shawarma is awesome and so is the rotisserie chicken served with a garlic sauch which is to die for . <sssss> and of course it is all halal which is great ! <sssss> we used to live in tucson and we still would come to baiz market to purchase all our halal meat because they keep it clean unlike the other so called halal meat stores we have visited . <sssss> the store is pretty big and they carry indian masalas , european cheeses , a variety of spices and canned goods and also some cutlery and pots and stuff to sell . <sssss> you will also be able to find a hookah here . <sssss> they have the best and most fresh pita breads too . <sssss> plus they have a large variety of fresh vegetables . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable except for the halal meat and chicken . <sssss> awesome place . <sssss> neighborhood is a little shady and you need to know your way around downtown . <sssss> there are no other shops around this place so when we go here , we just go to this shop and back home .
?		the scrambled eggs with croissant were good . <sssss> ambiance is non-existent . <sssss> no french bakery feel at all . <sssss> the products looked semi-appealing . <sssss> had a really hard time trying to find the damn place as it is hidden under a gargantuan office building . <sssss> i would not by any means call this a `` great '' french bakery .
?		we were there saturday night during the sunnyslope art walk and experienced just a 25 minute wait for four for seating on the patio . <sssss> do n't enter from the street , because the woman behind the bar did not nicely tell me to see the hostess on the other side . <sssss> do n't put yourself through that -- just enter from the parking lot/patio side . <sssss> having said that , the patio was gorgeous . <sssss> there 's a nice fire pit , lots of little seating areas , and gorgeous old trees and vines . <sssss> the service , on the other hand , was pretty terrible . <sssss> the sweet , young hostess tried her best to get us served , but it was futile . <sssss> we sat at a dirty table for 10 min . <sssss> or so . <sssss> then sat another 15 before she got a waitress for us . <sssss> our meals came out in a timely manner , but we had to ask for more water , ask for the the wine menu , etc. . <sssss> we got so tired of waiting we decided against another round and dessert . <sssss> what surprised me the most was that there seemed to be no one experienced supervising a really young staff . <sssss> no one -lrb- like a manager or owner -rrb- came through to check on tables or apologize for the wait at the table and lack of service . <sssss> the food was a bit better . <sssss> my girlfriend had the blt and chips . <sssss> the sandwich was large and a bit charred but she said it was great . <sssss> i had the bruschetta . <sssss> i highly recommend the spicy copa and pesto , which was excellent . <sssss> i 'd pass on the brie , apple and figs , as the figs were terribly bitter and the over-sauced bread quickly became soggy . <sssss> the wine and beer lists were reasonably priced for by the glass or bottle . <sssss> we 're hoping they improve on service for our next visit . <sssss> it smelled so good that we 'd like to give them another shot . <sssss> i just hope it was n't actually the little caesar 's nearby ...
?		we were the unfortunate recipients of $ 200 in romano 's gift cards , so we 've eaten there a few times recently . <sssss> the birthday dinner we had was ok . <sssss> we started with some of their new appetizers . <sssss> pass on them . <sssss> the pesto bean bruschetta lacked flavor -lrb- where was the pesto ?? <sssss> -rrb- and should have been served warm . <sssss> the peppers were ok . <sssss> the stuffed mushrooms were just boring . <sssss> our entrees came next . <sssss> i had a pumpkin ravioli , which was quite good . <sssss> hubby got the trio and did n't even bring the spaghetti home . <sssss> he said it was terrible . <sssss> birthday dessert was chocolate cake -- it was so bland it went uneaten . <sssss> the canoli were n't worth it , either . <sssss> we went back on a saturday night . <sssss> was told there was a 45 minute wait . <sssss> after 45 minutes they started seating people who arrived after us . <sssss> when i complained , she said they had a reservation . <sssss> i call bullsh-t on that . <sssss> then they seated another group that arrived after us . <sssss> then she said there were 7 more parties before us . <sssss> i told her to look around -- there were n't 7 parties left to be seated . <sssss> i was pissed . <sssss> there was no apology . <sssss> and no one over the age of 35 to complain too . <sssss> our waiter was aaron . <sssss> it took him 8 minutes to greet us . <sssss> we asked him three times for water for the table . <sssss> we never received the promised plate to share our woefully under-dressed salad . <sssss> i had the salmon entree and hubby had the porkchop . <sssss> both were cooked beautifully -lrb- and i had asked for the salmon pretty rare -rrb- -- really perfect . <sssss> too bad they had no flavor . <sssss> it was such a shame . <sssss> it was a terrible dinner , over all ... f -- me , i still have $ 40 to spend . <sssss> hubby and i went several years ago and loved it . <sssss> what happened ??
?		la condesa , i give up on you . <sssss> we try and try to excuse the terrible service , but no more . <sssss> it 's not worth it . <sssss> it 's too slow and inattentive and they just do n't give a damn , so i 'll take my $ 33 elsewhere . <sssss> this time we were disappointed by the food , too . <sssss> we returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless , and you brought us new ones after we finished eating . <sssss> you drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta -lrb- sorry , lonche -rrb- . <sssss> how do i pick it up and eat it ? <sssss> in the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss . <sssss> but not even that makes up for the service . <sssss> : -lrb-
?		very sexy place where people love to be seen . <sssss> very pretentious but i liked it ! <sssss> food is just ok - i have had better !
?		i stopped in to this fine establishment for the first time since i have lived in scottsdale and it was awesome . <sssss> i have eaten at other j alexanders before - and was always a fan - but this one rocked . <sssss> i had the steak kebobs - and they are amazing . <sssss> perfectly seared and medium - pink yumminess . <sssss> the cocktails were flowing and i had an awesome time . <sssss> the people around me were all super social and even though i was dining alone at the bar - i met new friends fast .
?		did you know that the capital grill is doing their generous pour for the summer ? <sssss> me either !! <sssss> i found out quickly enough though ! <sssss> so first let me say - i was lucky enough to be seated in the section of the most amazing waitress i have had the pleasure of dining with in many years ! <sssss> her name is sharon - and if you are making a reservation - i would ask for her - because she turned a mediocre night for me into an outstanding night . <sssss> her personality and passion for what she does shines in every word she uses . <sssss> i was intrigued and in awe from the first second !! <sssss> we ordered the wines - yes all of them ! <sssss> we drank well over our fair share - and loved every second . <sssss> let me describe dessert - coconut cream pie - oh my !!! <sssss> dreamy , decadent and a perfect ending to my feast . <sssss> i started with beef carpaccio - which was perfect . <sssss> the simplicity of this dish was amazing . <sssss> then i had the swordfish - which was prepared perfectly . <sssss> most restaurants tend to over do this dish - but capital grill nailed it ! <sssss> after all of my indulging , i was leaving and could not help but tell everyone , including sharon what a treat she was . <sssss> the funny part is - she actually took the time to send me a thank you card in the mail . <sssss> when was the last time anyone took that kind of time , in today 's world ? <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and see sharon again and of course have yummy food !!!
?		this place is always packed - bring some patience . <sssss> the food is very fresh and fantastic . <sssss> i have tried several dishes and none of them disappoint me .
?		-lrb- lyrics - imagine dragons - radioactive -rrb- i 'm ordering up shots and drinks i wipe my mouth as i eat the crust -lrb- pizza crust -rrb- i 'm breathing in the aromatics i 'm dining in , reviewing it , then checking out on the foodie bus this is it , the evo atmosphere yum ! <sssss> i 'm eating up , i taste it in my mouth enough to make my systems blow welcome to the evo , to the evo welcome to the evo , to the evo whoa , oh , oh , oh , oh , whoa , oh , oh , oh , it 's evo scottsdale , evo scottsdale whoa , oh , oh , oh , oh , whoa , oh , oh , oh , it 's evo scottsdale , evo scottsdale evo is located in a location where all the restaurants appear ... . <sssss> then disappears . <sssss> this is not a joke . <sssss> i reviewed several restaurants in that location and none is around . <sssss> now comes evo . <sssss> evo serves up modern american italian cuisine . <sssss> i 've heard so much about this place so my foodie friends and i finally convened and went for it . <sssss> i did some sharing after a free fireball shot after you check-in with the yelp app . <sssss> whooo ... now my breath smells fresh haha ! <sssss> my buddy and i ordered the margarita pizza and added sausage and the evo salad . <sssss> the pizza was okay , kind of tasted like pre-made dough . <sssss> the ingredients a top was nothing spectacular . <sssss> the evo salad was my favorite . <sssss> nicely charred kale and brussel sprouts and the pine nuts gave it that extra roast and crunch . <sssss> the aroma was nutty and a woody smell . <sssss> overall , one of the best salads i say around ! <sssss> service was good and the place itself is really chill and cool . <sssss> if anything another round of drinks and the evo salad is a must . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha he he he he he he he he he ... . <sssss> . <sssss> -lrb- woody woodpecker -rrb- for those of you old enough to know the woody woodpecker this place is a like an homage to the character . <sssss> the only way you 'll find this gem is by catching the eyes of the woodpecker off indian school rd. . <sssss> at first sight you would n't think much of this place from the outside . <sssss> once you enter it 's a nice cozy chill atmosphere . <sssss> i 'm glad this place is here far from the party scene of s. scottsdale . <sssss> everyone seems pretty relaxed and open . <sssss> they 're not here to impress anyone ; they 're here to have a good time . <sssss> the place in general is covered in `` wood '' and has a cabin look . <sssss> thus , the `` woody '' part makes sense . <sssss> moving , past the main doors and towards the back and going west of the building is the game room . <sssss> tad bit odd for a lounge , but totally awesome . <sssss> shuffle boards , skeet ball and darts in the back room while you have a drink with your best buds in case you did n't want to just sit around at the bar . <sssss> the large lcd tvs shows the game of the night while you sit back and enjoy . <sssss> the woody also serves up some cozy comfort food . <sssss> my buddy and i ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich . <sssss> i was n't too awed about the sandwich , but the toast on it made sense to my palate as i dipped it into the roasted tomato soup . <sssss> the soup was delicious ! <sssss> i pounded it down with a couple of drinks and my night was complete ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		not bad , i 've been to other locations , but this one would probably be my favorite for 2 reasons . <sssss> it 's the closet one to my place : -rrb- , 2nd their patio area is on 2nd floor overlooking the streets . <sssss> maybe i like looking over people and watching them or something , but it 's rather fun haha ! <sssss> gordon biersch is always known for their garlic fries -- do n't go to the gym the next day i tell ya if you have a bunch of these blah ! <sssss> they have their own gordon biersch brew of beers ; i do n't recall each , but they have beer tasting flight which can be fun . <sssss> definitely bring your group of friends to the place !
?		cambodian cuisine is definitely not one of those common cuisine you would pick when someone ask , `` what you wan na eat ? '' <sssss> -lrb- do n't say i do n't know ... ! <sssss> -rrb- however , now you can say how about cambodian ? <sssss> yes , the one and only one cambodian restaurant in phoenix is here ! <sssss> we had a group gathering here for dinner -lrb- naaap -rrb- and the food was delicious ! <sssss> i ca n't say the actual name , but i 'll use my best engrish - beef & shrimp marinated salad/beef skewers/pot roast soup/fried tilapia topped with mango . <sssss> okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine , but no dude ... it was awesome . <sssss> found out cambodian cuisine is not spicy like i thought it would be . <sssss> our service was great , this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - kudos ! <sssss> ambience was really homey - i gather if i lived in a cambodian household that is ... the decors were originally from cambodia purchased by the owner -lrb- yut -rrb- . <sssss> i did n't want to touch anything ; felt like i was in a museum . <sssss> towards the end of the night i start to make dessert - yes `` me '' was cooking ! <sssss> they showed us how and what ingredients . <sssss> needless , to say i did n't perfect the art , but it still passed and was yummy ! <sssss> take that chef ramsey ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		i was a skeptic of this chemist of brew . <sssss> needless to say , i was n't too far off . <sssss> this is great for a night out with the boys to watch the game . <sssss> that 's all i can say since i would n't recommend coming here to chat . <sssss> i ordered me a beer and some fried fish and chips . <sssss> i do n't like soggy food , but i guess that 's how it comes here . <sssss> the fried fish was laid on top of my garlic fries , which were way greasy . <sssss> as the fish and fries came together it was a hot soggy mess . <sssss> i might want to add tasteless too . <sssss> the place definitely has a pub look and feel . <sssss> live music when i came that night , but the football game was going on too . <sssss> rowdy fans and loud music does n't go well , but i guess it would n't matter after a few drinks . <sssss> our service was good , but splitting checks again can be a challenge . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		starbucks with a dash of alcholic beverage - sweeeet ! <sssss> just when you thought it could n't be improved well you 're wrong ! <sssss> press is a cute little cafe located in city north , unfortunately : -lrb- however , this place brings the smiles back . <sssss> trendy and hip for sure . <sssss> food here is wonderful - light sandwiches and salads with ingredients that bring a bang to your mouth -- mmmm . <sssss> did n't try their wine , but no one can stop me now - next time i 'm back let 's do a toast ! <sssss> enjoy !
?		i can dig the bbq here . <sssss> food was pretty good and portions were just right . <sssss> i appreciate the wide selection of bbq items , but i only ordered two - half ck & pull pork and they were both good . <sssss> decor is alright , but i 've definitely seen a better bbq joint or i guess i should say more southern style-like . <sssss> it 's a chain and i got ta give them a break - `` a '' for effort . <sssss> i really like the porch style seating , but really wonder what it 's like during the hot summers hmmm ... just makes me skirm when i think about eating and sweating at the same time - yuck ! <sssss> i got ta make a come back to taste the rest of the bbq items for sure ! <sssss> so if you 're craving for some bbq hit me up ! <sssss> : -rrb-
?		so apparently the creators of tk 's urban tavern wanted great food with great atmosphere where people ate ... ummm sure makes sense right . <sssss> okay , why not , sounds like a great concept . <sssss> this place was an eye catcher simply because if it 's location on the corner . <sssss> the contemporary look gave it the relaxing chill feel . <sssss> we ordered some sides the mac & cheese and a salad with goat cheese -- both were awesome ! <sssss> however , i ca n't say our entrees were great - 33 % . <sssss> my pulled pork sandwich was bland , and according to my friend her burger was bland . <sssss> only thing that popped was the scallops over a shrimp risotto . <sssss> so in the end 33 % , which i 'll give it an okay in my book . <sssss> service overall was great and on the dot . <sssss> in any case , i do n't think tk would be my first choice next time i 'm at scottsdale quarters . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		-lrb- lyrics - kelis - milkshake -rrb- fox concept brings all of us to the yard , and they 're like it 's tastier than before , damn right it 's tastier than before , you can dine here , but they have to charge fox concept brings all of us to the yard , and they 're like it 's tastier than before , damn right it 's tastier than before , you can dine here , but they have to charge i know you want it , the thing that makes you hungry , what all of us go crazy for . <sssss> they lose their minds , the way we dine , i think its time la la-la la la , warm it up . <sssss> lala-lalala , we 're all waiting the yard is an interesting place . <sssss> two different dining experiences ; one from what i gather a seafood/oyster restaurant and the other is the culinary dropout . <sssss> culinary dropout i would describe is modern american cuisine . <sssss> great small bites to share so we ordered the pretzel with cheese , bacon with grilled cheese and the mussels . <sssss> the pretzels were soft and doughy while the creamy cheese helped with the chewing process , if you know what i mean . <sssss> the bacon and grilled cheese sandwich really worked well together . <sssss> that 's gon na be my new thing grilled cheese and bacon ; why did n't i think of this ! <sssss> finally , the mussels with the broth , which i still ca n't figure what it is ... yummy ! <sssss> overall my favorite of the night and definitely a recommendation . <sssss> drinks are pretty pricey , and the games around `` the yard '' are pretty cool . <sssss> ping pong tables , foosball , and corn hole games spread across the place . <sssss> it reminds me of an east coast roof top bar feel with the couches and the live band rocking away . <sssss> it can get real loud here , but if you ca n't handle the noise keep your butt at home and enjoy a glass of wine . <sssss> in the end , this is the closet thing to a night life in central area of phoenix . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		this place is n't bad at all . <sssss> i 've definitely had better tofu soup . <sssss> however if you 're hungry for some korean food ; it 'll do the work . <sssss> service was good not too much to complain about - it is what it is . <sssss> all the staffs were wearing black - johnny cash korean style !! <sssss> decor was pretty cheap and basic asian style . <sssss> funny thing i thought - they were bumping hip hop . <sssss> guess you got ta be hip and tough to have your kim chi here -- i think i 'm tough enough : -rrb- - enjoy !
?		my favorite place on a monday or tuesday night ! <sssss> $ 20 for a huge plate of bruschettas and a bottle of wine ... need i say more ? <sssss> the atmosphere is just right . <sssss> low key and classy feel . <sssss> i almost want to say starbucks for wine , but i think it 's pushing it . <sssss> i do n't mind attending this fine dine and wine place any other night , but if you 're free on monday or tuesday ... why not ?
?		pad see ew ! <sssss> it 's what i always order or the dragon noodles if they serve it . <sssss> wow me with the pad see ew and it 's all good . <sssss> how 's this place do , well i was wow 'd and in sweatin ' -- fire breathe ! <sssss> i generally gage a thai place by how well their fried noodles taste . <sssss> kudos -- however , i ca n't say the same for the appetizers . <sssss> fried tofu need more crunch ! <sssss> our service was excellent and do n't `` phuket '' the beer : -rrb- great hh prices on the drinks . <sssss> i like the ambience , but i wish thai restaurants would get more creative with their design . <sssss> i know it 's a thai restaurant when i see one . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		nice patio and large enough for a crowd . <sssss> x-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the friends opening credit - yes , i 'll be there for you ! <sssss> came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless i must rate the place . <sssss> we had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette , but things went downhill from here fast . <sssss> let 's start with the pork ; cough ! <sssss> cough ! <sssss> -lrb- pound the chest ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> someone pass me some water cause as much as i chewed it did n't go down - it was so dry it soaked up my saliva ! <sssss> atop of it were some chili flakes so that did n't help much . <sssss> the stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce , but i do n't recall what it tasted like . <sssss> the pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury do n't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more ! <sssss> regardless , a friend of mine made a great point ; we are served what we did not order . <sssss> saved ! <sssss> therefore , i shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned !
?		i must say they really spruce this place up . <sssss> makes my vietnamese food taste better too i think : -rrb- not to say i dislike hole in walls , but ao sen really paid attention to their decors . <sssss> to the food ! <sssss> we ordered an appetizer to start - had coconut milk and noodles , forgot what it was called , but like my friend said ; `` can you go wrong with coconut milk . '' <sssss> i order a # 29 - i do n't speak or read viet , but it sure tasted dandy ! <sssss> i was trying to be different and not order the `` phonomenal '' - maybe it was the feel of the place ; it just did n't make me really want pho . <sssss> anyways , # 29 was a pork/beef lettuce noodle wrap - fun and yum ! <sssss> chances or return very high ... enjoy !
?		i have to admit i expected more from this place than i got . <sssss> here 's the deal , you want decent hh for a low price ? <sssss> you got it ! <sssss> you want good service too ? <sssss> no problem . <sssss> you want good food -- whoa there cowboy ! <sssss> if this place was small dive i would totally understand , but hey you just happen to be in the scottsdale quarter where everything must be a hit right ? <sssss> right !? <sssss> needless to say i appreciate our aussie bartender he was cool ! <sssss> the ambience is alright -- not my cup of tea -- got that cigar smoking lounge , sport bar flare and a stage for live band just in case . <sssss> do n't get me wrong i dig live bands . <sssss> maybe just not in this setting . <sssss> prices , like i said were good , but i guess you get for what you pay for - enjoy !
?		suavemente , besame yo quiero restaurant mexico besandorne otra vez suave , besame besame suave , yo quiero restaurant mexico sauve , okay-o i do n't know spanish sauve , but i really like this song besame indeed , man i was totally hungry walking into restaurant mexico ! <sssss> this little shop down on mill ave. after a few drinks or two . <sssss> this place hit the spot . <sssss> i ca n't say it was the best i ever had . <sssss> however , the service was really good . <sssss> i ordered the basic taco meal with beans and rice . <sssss> like most mexican restaurants they offer free chips and salsa . <sssss> salsa was good and the chips seem pretty solid in a good way . <sssss> my taco entree came quick right after i order leading me to think of it like cafeteria food . <sssss> i guess it was so quick i had in mind some lady slopping it onto my plate while smoking a cigarette . <sssss> i 'm sure that 's not the case . <sssss> moreover , my tacos were good . <sssss> nice shredded beef in a deep fried taco shell . <sssss> my favorites were the rice because they were a tad bit different from what i was used to . <sssss> mexican rice is generally pretty bland , but here it was nice soft and sweet . <sssss> one of the best i 've had i must add ! <sssss> overall , experience at the restaurant mexico is good . <sssss> it 's right in the heart of college town so my surprise was the pricing . <sssss> i guess when i went to college long long long time ago food was much cheaper ! <sssss> wow kids are rich these days ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		get off of my fork get into my mouth get off of that grill get into some sauce -lrb- bbq -rrb- get into my belly yum yum , yeah get outta my mind get into my life oooooooooh oh i said hey -lrb- hey -rrb- you -lrb- you -rrb- get into my belly -lrb- lyrics - billy ocean - get into my car -rrb- pork on a fork was showcased on drive-in , dives , and diners with guy fieri not too long ago . <sssss> from there they 've became a hit and won numerous awards , plus rave reviews both on yelp and from foodies around the valley . <sssss> needless to say , this place is pretty darn good would n't you say ! <sssss> my office is close by so whenever i get a chance i try to hit the fork . <sssss> their pulled pork sandwich is what i would consider the quintessential pulled pork meal . <sssss> with sides of fingerling potatoes and coleslaw . <sssss> good ' o boys meal i guess , but man the pork and soft and tender ; add some spicy bbq and finger licking good -- yummy ! <sssss> portions here are modest i think so you wo n't over eat in my opinion . <sssss> the place itself started in modest fashion . <sssss> when i first came there was maybe 6 tables max , but now they have an entire huge patio in the back . <sssss> let 's just after having a meal here you 'll need more room - wink ! <sssss> again , this place is a dive so take the boys out and leave the dating scene out ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		oh fez ! <sssss> what country was that guy from again ? <sssss> : -rrb- i rather enjoy fez , i really do n't expect much from this place but they always deliver . <sssss> sweet potato fries with cinnamon ... yum ! <sssss> their menu is innovative ... things i would never thought that would go well together . <sssss> yet , it works ... it really really works . <sssss> : -rrb- if you looking to grab a drink or two ... not bad spot to pick in downtown phoenix .
?		chinese pho !? <sssss> how about vietnamese fried rice ? <sssss> well needless to say maxim is a mixture of two cultures . <sssss> my two cultures it happens to be and what i am - half vietnamese and half chinese . <sssss> so our waitress and some of the staffs are speaking in cantonese and serving up some pho . <sssss> eh ! <sssss> i 'm not one to judge . <sssss> i order me some pho since i heard this place was one of the better pho places in town . <sssss> i have to admit it was a lot different from most pho places , but that 's about it . <sssss> i did enjoy it and now that i think about it i 'm glad i did n't order the big boy bowl . <sssss> i can only eat so much and so much i ate . <sssss> the broth was nice and hot and had that bold brown color . <sssss> my noodles were obviously not soaked well since i had to untangle it before eating it . <sssss> i do n't like to see or do that , thus it 's a negative in my book . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		for what it is ... meh it 's okay . <sssss> food is edible and will get you full for sure . <sssss> i 'm not all into the decor - tad bit tacky , but i whatever floats your boat . <sssss> service was lacking granted i understand lunch rushes , but seriously you do n't have to ask if i need a refill 10 times when my glass is still half full - where 's my tamales anyways ! <sssss> i guess if you 're really craving for some mexican food it 'll do the job just fine .
?		-lrb- lyrics - george michael - faith -rrb- well i guess it would be nice if i could taste your craft beer i know not everybody has got a brewery like yours but i 've got to sip twice before i give my heart away and i know all the games you will play because it 's on direc tv too ! <sssss> oh but i need some pizza from that hunger cry time to pick my fork up off the plate oh , when that pie comes out with that aroma well , it takes a strong appetite baby but i 'm showin you my mouth cause ' i got ta have fate i got ta have fate because i got ta have fate , a fate , a fate i got ta have fate , a fate , a fate fate is a local brewing company located in scottsdale . <sssss> there used to be life around here back in the days when devil 's martini existed . <sssss> still some small hot spots here and there ; the there is fate . <sssss> the only beer brewing restaurant around ; this cute little brewery spices up the night life back into the area . <sssss> i shared the olive side and a capicola pizza with a pal . <sssss> if you like olives this was a delight . <sssss> nicely dripping in it 's own juice with a salty punch to your palates . <sssss> the firewood pizza that we ordered was okay i thought . <sssss> the crust got dried out quickly and the toppings did the same . <sssss> kept on drinking to finish it off ! <sssss> drinking was not what i did here though . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of craft beers , but can appreciate it . <sssss> we sampled all their beers and my favorite and also strongest was the belgo american tripel . <sssss> strong indeed cause i started to buzz a little after one ! <sssss> light weight here ! <sssss> anyways , the other beer were strong also and extra bitter to me . <sssss> almost like an ipa which i despise ! <sssss> all you ipa drinkers can hate ... go ahead . <sssss> overall , the atmosphere is great and the service was awesome . <sssss> drinks were fine , but not my cup of tea and the food was okay . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		-lrb- lyrics - adele - set fire to the rain -rrb- i 'll eat it in , a bag and as it cooks , i 'll add the spice to it it was dark as i stir it over until you added to your menu and you saved me my palate , it 's strong but my appetite were far too weak to stay away from your ads without falling to my feet but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew all the time i thought it was only in a bag was never true , never true and at the prices you had , i would always buy ; always buy -lrb- $ .25 a bag ! <sssss> -rrb- but i had ramen at the posh ! <sssss> savour the taste as i stuffed my face ! <sssss> let it burn while i cry cause i could taste it screaming with flavors , with flavors ! <sssss> posh is an improvisational kitchen , which means like improv comedy they create as they go . <sssss> well somewhat i guess ... they utilize seasonal ingredients to create a daily menu . <sssss> you pick and choose what meals you want from a list , which often times range from 3-7 courses . <sssss> if you ever been to restaurant week then it 's a similar concept . <sssss> the night i went was ramen noodles night or late night japanese eats ! <sssss> i do n't really know if they really eat this late in japan , but i guess that 's what we 're doing ! <sssss> there were 3 different noodle dishes and 2 japanese beers . <sssss> the noodles were sesame , soy , and miso , while beer selection was orion and coedo . <sssss> i was n't totally thrilled about either of the beer . <sssss> along with the noodles we ordered the okonomiyaki , a pancake like dish with came with sprouts and bacon . <sssss> i thought it was good and savory , but the mayo and bacon was quite overpowering . <sssss> i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but less bacon please ... i ordered the soy broth with my ramen while my friends seem to all order the sesame . <sssss> i did n't get a chance to taste anybody else 's dish , but mine was pretty good . <sssss> it came with braised pork , scallions , and i believe radishes . <sssss> nice and warm and yes i know on a warm summer phx night , but it worked . <sssss> ramen is so adaptable to so many ingredients . <sssss> to me , it 's all about the broth . <sssss> if you can create a good broth then you can put tree bark and chocolate in the ramen and i 'll still eat it ! <sssss> according to the waiter , which i might add did n't really do a good job , said they intend to have ramen night every wednesday starting at 9pm . <sssss> so gear up you ramen fans cause now you have a place to go every wednesday night ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		ever yelped so much you forgot if you yelped about a place or not ? <sssss> well lucky me -- i forgot about this place , then again maybe for good reason . <sssss> for all the hype and cool designs -- the food really did n't match . <sssss> i ordered some curry and chicken - it was okay , but i was really hungry so maybe that 's why it was okay . <sssss> the plating was nice , but maybe that 's how they get you ! <sssss> how about the price ? <sssss> extremely pricy for what you get -- i get more excited paying to gas up my car ! <sssss> okay the ambience is pretty cool - the polynesian style decors are nice and fun . <sssss> service ? <sssss> well we had a large group and i can never understand this , but when you 're a waiter ; you should prepare for large and small groups . <sssss> i was a damn fine waiter in my times and i was always ready to rock ! <sssss> i wo n't say they did n't do a good job , but -- they did n't do a good job -- : -rrb- i lied ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		i 'm all about the food . <sssss> ladies , this place was made to cater to your needs . <sssss> champagne , tea , and girlfriends . <sssss> think i was one of the only few dudes besides the bartender around . <sssss> i like my odds . <sssss> i saw a few guys walk in and walk out ... haha this is n't their local dive bar i guess . <sssss> narcisse is a chic , modern , and hip . <sssss> plush couches and a high ceiling with hanging decors to attract your eyes . <sssss> you know what else attracts your eyes ? <sssss> go to the men 's room -- you 'll see what i mean . <sssss> we ordered some appetizers and bruschettas and boy were they yummy ! <sssss> meatballs were decent and so were the white shrimp . <sssss> the best was the carpacio ! <sssss> it literally melts on your palate . <sssss> the bruschettas rivals the best in phx ! <sssss> they do n't crumble when you take a bite and all the toppings stay aboard while you savor the moment . <sssss> mmmm ... ! <sssss> our service was great since there were only 2 in the party plus only a couple of tables . <sssss> i gather this place is popping during the weekends . <sssss> according to the bartender ; the closest thing to a vegas nightclub . <sssss> hmm , debauchery and immorality ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		i ca n't say i 'm a big fan of buffets . <sssss> i can never eat enough to make it worth while . <sssss> seriously , how can you keep stuffing your face after an hour ! <sssss> however , i enjoyed my visit to this buffet . <sssss> nice sunday dinner gathering with the family . <sssss> i was impressed with some of the exotic varieties . <sssss> frog legs , beef tendon , octopus , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> i feel like andrew zimmerman ! <sssss> bizarre foods with bao hoang : -rrb- aside from the exotic ingredients the food from the buffet was n't bad at all . <sssss> sushi seemed `` fresh '' ... plus , coronas and bud lights for $ 1 with food ... man i 'm coming here just for the drinks ! <sssss> i like their decor since i am asian i dig asian art . <sssss> they definitely added an extra flare to make the place pop - totally dig the decor surrounding the sushi bar . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		lunch at cibo . <sssss> we sat outside on a cool early december day and i must say that cibo has the best atmosphere of any outside dining establishment in downtown phoenix . <sssss> the pizza is n't as good as pizzaria bianco -lrb- pb -rrb- but i 'm more likely to return to cibo over pb due to the outside atmosphere . <sssss> if you want to skip the pizza go for it , but do n't skip the nutella crepe . <sssss> service was on the slow side , but i would say normal for any restaurant serving tables outside . <sssss> i think it stems from how far the servers have to go from the kitchen and bar to outside . <sssss> i will return .
?		this upstairs patio is 3 stars and the dining room is 5 stars . <sssss> service on the upstairs patio is slow , but the view was nice . <sssss> in addition , i did n't get a refill on my coffee due to i 'm guessing the distance the server would have had to go to get it for me . <sssss> the grilled cheese and tomato soup was above par . <sssss> the wedge salad was delicious , the pizza also delicious . <sssss> i have n't had drinks here yet , but i 'm sure they 're fine . <sssss> service inside the dining room was considerably better than the upstairs patio .
?		it 's a good gym . <sssss> the staff is nothing but nice to me and my guests . <sssss> they remember my name and i would recommend the gym to anyone . <sssss> i also like that the showers have doors that lock as opposed to curtains . <sssss> i would agree with some of the other reviews in regards to the 40 dollar -lrb- price guarantee -rrb- b.s. fee . <sssss> that explains the 4 over 5 star review .
?		i considered lying and stating in my review that the dogs were awful solely to reduce the number of people waiting in line for them , but i realized that would be extremely selfish . <sssss> i am astounded that the hot dog i ate was as good as it was . <sssss> everyone should try one of these dogs .
?		worth a visit . <sssss> the food is solid , the atmosphere interesting , the prices surprisingly cheap . <sssss> mimosas and bloody marys -lrb- big ones -rrb- for 3 bucks . <sssss> that 's what i 'm talking about . <sssss> i 've eaten here twice and both times the service was good . <sssss> i will return .
?		solid diner style breakfast place . <sssss> the food is nothing special , but it 's always up to par . <sssss> the price is reasonable as well , and they always seem relatively clean .
?		tuck shop you 've got nothing on lo lo 's chicken and waffles . <sssss> i wanted to love your chicken and waffles , but it was too weird . <sssss> cheese in the waffle ? <sssss> the pork tenderloin saved the day for us . <sssss> it is well worth returning solely for that dish . <sssss> the atmosphere is great , the service was par , the price was reasonable . <sssss> i would recommend this establishment to others and i will return . <sssss> -lrb- for the pork tenderloin -rrb-
?		the cheese selection is very large and reasonably priced for the kinds of cheese available . <sssss> that is not to say that duck and decanter is cheap . <sssss> i prefer the staff at the north central location over this location . <sssss> duck and decanter almost has a monopoly on unique cheeses , coffees , teas , etcs . <sssss> the only other real option is aj 's and the prices there are exorbitant .
?		they burned the espresso beans in my cappuccino . <sssss> it 's a coffee shop right ? <sssss> they should make good coffee and espresso drinks . <sssss> if you ca n't do a cappuccino right you have no business being in the coffee business . <sssss> in addition , it took forever to get my bagel and cream cheese -lrb- over 15min -rrb- . <sssss> a wednesday at 10am is hardly an overly busy time . <sssss> am i wrong to expect prompt efficient and quality service from a coffee house . <sssss> i had three sips of the cappuccino and pitched it . <sssss> the bagel was fine , but its not as though they are baking them in the back . <sssss> save your money and go to lux or even starbucks for that matter .
?		i just had a cookie . <sssss> it was the equivalent to recieving oral sex . <sssss> i apologize , in advance , for my rather obscene remark , but these cookies are that ` effing good . <sssss> i supported it by buying 5 cookies . <sssss> i went back insideafter eating my first to tell the owner it was the best i ever had . <sssss> it is not my fault that this place can bake orgasms into cookies . <sssss> i too would like a world where there were cookie stores on every block . <sssss> particularly urban cookies . <sssss> i 'm happy .
?		shivers . <sssss> i got the fa-reaking shivers eating here , it was so good . <sssss> clean , delicious , original , simple - fucking awesome . <sssss> whats a macaron ? <sssss> it 's an edible version of megan fox , that 's what it is . <sssss> shut it , buy one and trust me .
?		3.5 stars . <sssss> food = very good service = not bad , though it took 20 minutes to get the check after we were done . <sssss> he apologized . <sssss> drink -lrb- singular -rrb- = amaretto sour at metro b. = not made with amaretto but cost = $ 12.00 usd . <sssss> i drew a picture of one dude plowing another dudes ass on the bill to show my displeasure . <sssss> i 'll pay 12.00 a drink for a fine bordeaux , or something huge and colorful that 's to be drunk from a monkey 's skull . <sssss> not a lowboy filled with amaretto substitute and cherry juice . <sssss> metro b , get your shit together .
?		i 'd say a solid 2.5 stars , if that was an option . <sssss> the restaurant was neat looking , i really liked the atmosphere and decor , and found the service to be awesome . <sssss> it 's just that the food was so unbelievably meh . <sssss> c'mon ! <sssss> with competition like `` the parlor '' and `` pizzeria bianco '' you 'd think they be cranking out some really tasty pies . <sssss> we had the pear - gorgonzola and the egg pizza . <sssss> lemmie tell ya , i shoulda been weeping with flavor-gasm after eating such tasty titles . <sssss> i have pizza blue-balls instead . <sssss> , ftl . <sssss> i would n't say no if someone wanted to buy me dinner here again , but i certainly would n't volunteer my soon to be unemployment check dollars here either .
?		omg , i am delirious . <sssss> this event was right up my alley , all the sweetness and carbs necessary to put me on a comma . <sssss> lgo went all out and provided full size items . <sssss> the cookies were gigantic . <sssss> since my hubby was sent away on business , i asked my friend maryanne to come with me . <sssss> i am so glad , because we shared the items we sampled . <sssss> i could n't possibly sample as much . <sssss> i loved one of the cakes that had the peaches on top , so moist and delicious . <sssss> the cookies were great , but what amazed us the most was the home made english muffins , omg , they are so delicious . <sssss> my friend ended up buying some to take home to her family . <sssss> the gelato sampling was awesome , i loved , loved , loved the peach sorbetto , so refreshing . <sssss> the mint , chocolate chip was great , also . <sssss> i could taste the fresh specs of mint . <sssss> my friend gave me a great idea for the twins birthday . <sssss> i am going to have lgo cater an ice cream social for us . <sssss> hopefully they can make the cookies a little smaller . <sssss> they can make any flavor ice cream you want as long as you order at least a gallon , which is going to be easy , most of my twins ' guests come in pairs , so the number is pretty high . <sssss> thank you , lindsey for setting this amazing event up and of course all the people from lgo who were so gracious and informative .
?		i am disappointed . <sssss> i wanted to like this place . <sssss> my husband and i decided to give this place a try . <sssss> big mistake . <sssss> what a waste of a `` date night '' . <sssss> it was very busy , so we decided to sit at the bar . <sssss> not a minute after we sat down one of the girls behind the bar broke a glass and shards flew in our direction . <sssss> my husband was hit in the face and even pieces of glass were in his hair . <sssss> what did this girl do ? <sssss> nothing , lifted her head and asked `` did i hit you ? '' <sssss> my response was , `` i think you can see glass all over his hair and in front of him '' . <sssss> under her breath she said `` sorry '' and turned around to take care of other people . <sssss> i asked someone else at the bar if this is the way they welcome their patrons , because i might be missing something . <sssss> eventually one of the managers came and apologized and bought us a round of drinks . <sssss> the sushi is not great , is your typical load of mayonnaise to mask everything . <sssss> there are better places for sushi .
?		i have been coming here for a few years , it is not my first choice . <sssss> it seems we always have a birthday or someone else 's get together , the food and service is good , however for my personal taste it is not something memorable .
?		not very impressed with this place . <sssss> the food was ok but nothing i would go back for . <sssss> if my friends want to meet there again , i might go . <sssss> i did n't care for my chicken chopped salad . <sssss> i had time that afternoon , so i did n't mind the service being slow . <sssss> my friend and i had n't seen each other in a couple of weeks so we were catching up . <sssss> the location is very nice .
?		this is an outdoors person 's heaven . <sssss> that is not me , but i can appreciate it . <sssss> i came here because they had a killer deal on keen shoes for the kids . <sssss> we love those shoes , but paying $ 50 a piece can bite , so when they were 50 % off , i got 2 pairs for each kid .
?		what a fabulous place . <sssss> we had a blast last night and we ca n't wait to come back with the twins .
?		this location has it down ! <sssss> they know how to handle families with kids . <sssss> we come here about once every ten days . <sssss> they are very fast and always bring the kids food first , which makes for a more relaxed time -lrb- if you can relax with two year olds -rrb- . <sssss> the twins love the chicken nuggets and last time they had sundaes for the first time ! <sssss> my little boy grabbed the cup and chugged the last drops down . <sssss> we 've been to other locations , however this one has the best service and my husband thinks the best and strongest margaritas -lrb- hey , daddy needs a margarita , too -rrb-
?		i enjoy this place . <sssss> i usually go at night with a group of moms and we love it . <sssss> the food is very good . <sssss> i finally tasted the evil jungle princess beef that my friend raved about . <sssss> it was really delicious . <sssss> i love the black orchid ahi tuna . <sssss> i went for lunch with my husband and we had a great time . <sssss> the bartender , paul is great . <sssss> my husband 's house margarita was really good . <sssss> the prices are so reasonable . <sssss> i ca n't wait for my next moms night out .
?		what a pity , i thought we had found a new spot for happy hour . <sssss> after reading the reviews , i was very excited to try this spot . <sssss> even though my husband wanted to go to the cove i convinced him to try a new spot . <sssss> the place is nice but the food was just good . <sssss> we tried the green chili pork and the lobster tacos . <sssss> i liked the lobster tacos , but the green chili pork was bland and i know bland , i have tasted the baby food i used to give my twins when they were smaller . <sssss> the wine choices are very few and the ones for hh are not good at all . <sssss> i tried the pinot noir and it was awful so i settled for the cabernet . <sssss> we decided to have dessert , we chose the chocolate cake with flan . <sssss> not good at all . <sssss> the flan portion was overcooked and so dry . <sssss> andrea the bartender was nice enough to notice and take it off our bill .
?		this was our third time at fez and i was debating whether to give it a 4 , due to our last experience , but the sweet potato fries alone deserve the 5 . <sssss> i think it was a little hectic this past saturday , so i am going to overlook the service . <sssss> my husband had the tangiers burger , it was awesome . <sssss> i had the phyllo chicken pockets , yummy . <sssss> our friends had the fez burger . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come for lunch and have my own burger . <sssss> we love the ambiance and how cool this place is . <sssss> it is such a pity that we have to drive so far to find gems . <sssss> phoenix has some awesome restaurants !
?		thank you fellow yelpers , this place is fantastic . <sssss> i have been wanting to come and check it out for a while . <sssss> this place is definitely worth the 52 mile round trip drive . <sssss> i had the carne asada burrito . <sssss> i had read so much about it i was salivating while my order was getting ready . <sssss> my hubby had one carne asada taco and one barbacoa . <sssss> both were delicious , too . <sssss> we also ordered the guacamole , excellent . <sssss> this place is a little gem . <sssss> ca n't wait co come back , i will try the fish platter another diner was having , it looked really good .
?		wow , wow , wow . <sssss> my hubby and i have been wanting to come to breadfruit for a while . <sssss> my hubby has been to jamaica and all over the caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine . <sssss> we decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this saturday . <sssss> we did n't have a reservation , but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders . <sssss> tony and beth were so nice and efficient . <sssss> tony just moved from portland in november , so we had a nice conversation with him about the area -lrb- we spend summers in or -rrb- . <sssss> i had a mojito , wow , the best mojito i have had in the valley , probably ever . <sssss> my hubby had the caipirinha . <sssss> it was so good . <sssss> we thought we would have one appetizer and leave . <sssss> so we ordered the scallops , then the plantain and avocado spring rolls . <sssss> they were so delicious . <sssss> the scallops were spicy , it was like fireworks in my mouth , in a good way . <sssss> i loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls . <sssss> my hubby wanted the soup of the day , the pumpkin and sweet potato soup . <sssss> i ended up eating most of it . <sssss> since i was dd , the hubby had another drink , this time the kingston rum punch , wow , that was strong but tasty . <sssss> tony recommended the rum glazed prawns and roti flatbread , double wow . <sssss> my hubby had a pina colada to wash that down . <sssss> that was the best pc i 've had . <sssss> not the blended coco lopez type . <sssss> for dessert we had their bread pudding . <sssss> this was the only thing i was not that crazy about , do n't get me wrong , i still ate it . <sssss> i am just used to the new orleans type of bread pudding , more gooey . <sssss> the experience at rum bar was so great we ca n't wait to come back and bring friends .
?		my hubby and i went to the uye set up by liz s. last sunday . <sssss> we had a really great time . <sssss> the buffet was very good . <sssss> i am a fan of yellow curry . <sssss> i wish it was not tofu , though . <sssss> i had a taste of everything . <sssss> the only thing i skipped was the donut hole thingys . <sssss> i am being adventurous with beers also , so i asked them to suggest one , i had the chang . <sssss> it was perfect with my meal . <sssss> this is such a reasonable place , you can enjoy your meal , watch the game , yes , they had the game on tv , have a beer and relax . <sssss> the buffet was only $ 9.50 . <sssss> thanks liz , for setting this up , we got to experience a great place .
?		i really liked this place , i have never thought of coming here to shop , but after all i am a mallrat , love malls . <sssss> i know , so 90s . <sssss> i had an appointment in chandler , so i did n't know how long if would take me to get there , so i decided to leave early . <sssss> well at that time of day and with no traffic , chandler was not that far . <sssss> so i had about an hour and a half to kill so i headed to the mall , thank you gps . <sssss> this place is huge , in an hour an a half i barely checked one section . <sssss> i want to go back to see what else is there . <sssss> looks really clean and spacious . <sssss> ca n't wait to be back . <sssss> i guess i need to have another blonde moment and make an appointment somewhere in chandler .
?		i am a little disappointed , i drove all the way to essence to try the macarons . <sssss> i have been to france several times , and being a pastry and sweets lover , i would stop by several patisseries and stock up with goodies for my train ride . <sssss> the macarons at essence seem a little too chewy , maybe because they have so much sugar . <sssss> a macaron is basically eggs whites , ground almonds and sugar . <sssss> if there is too much sugar , it is not going to be as crispy and flaky . <sssss> they also seem to have too much cream in the middle . <sssss> i had the caramel and the vanilla . <sssss> my husband had the chocolate and the mocha . <sssss> from the 4 choices , vanilla was by far the best . <sssss> the chocolate was go sticky and chewy , even my husband could n't finish it , and he does n't usually leave a dessert . <sssss> maybe this is good for my waist line .
?		great staff and wonderful food , this place hits the spot .
?		i was hoping for more out of this place : -lrb- i do n't think i will be returning for a round 2 . <sssss> place could work on its service a little .
?		best pho hands down , boba bar has a good selection . <sssss> very clean too !
?		fun neighborhood bar , with a new backroom filled with fun games such as skeeball !
?		love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing ! <sssss> the bartender cj is da bomb !
?		i went here today for a belated mother 's day lunch and loved every minute of it . <sssss> my mom ordered the egg white frittata with a side of potatoes and i ordered the rice bowl and added chicken . <sssss> the ambiance is very warm and inviting , it reminded me a lot like portland -lrb- my old hood -rrb- . <sssss> the servers were very friendly and helpful . <sssss> i will definitely be back for breakfast , lunch , dinner , coffee , and desert .
?		so yummy ! <sssss> my favorite cookies are the dark chocolate with walnuts . <sssss> it is a good thing that they are a tad pricey otherwise i would spend my lunch money on cookies everyday : -rrb-
?		not sure where you 'd find a better street taco in phoenix . <sssss> the al pastor is awesome , as is the fish , and the shrimp . <sssss> i did n't try the carne asada , but athena says its great . <sssss> they were out of chorizo . <sssss> dammit . <sssss> note : many other patrons had to study the menu when they were informed of the chorizo outage . <sssss> apparently it 's a fave and a `` go-to '' item . <sssss> i went with my usual number of 6 street tacos . <sssss> athena had 3 with black beans - which were creamy and dee-lish . <sssss> that 's about the right way to do it for us , although others opted for 10 tacos or 2-3 tacos and a burrito . <sssss> one lady -lrb- seemingly a regular -rrb- went directly for some type of tostada . <sssss> seems you ca n't go wrong however you do it . <sssss> everyone there went with the mexican cokes , except for one guy that had a diet coke . <sssss> whatevs . <sssss> i did n't ask about the $ 7 toasted tortilla . <sssss> although , as one of the most expensive items on the menu - we were curious . <sssss> it cant just be a tortilla can it ? <sssss> historical note : some of you may recall this place used to be the best place for a great chicago dog ... mr. mort 's , until he retired long ago . <sssss> i miss that place , but this is a great replacement ! <sssss> traffic note : the light rail construction makes this place a bit tricky to get into , but not too bad . <sssss> vacation note : if you are reading this between july 2-9th , 2013 : it 'll be closed for their vacation !
?		just a quick update . <sssss> i 've been here numerous times now , and everything is always great . <sssss> clean , friendly , efficient staff . <sssss> picture and sound quality remain excellent .
?		they brew a decent beer . <sssss> last time i was there i tried some crazy-high ibu ipa , or dipa from the cask - which was quite smooth and an excellent brunch beer despite the amount of hops . <sssss> the food is fairly standard brew-pub fare . <sssss> you can get shrimp sliders , burgers ... that kind of thing . <sssss> as for their website - u can click on that link above , but it wo n't do you much good . <sssss> they do n't seem to update it ever - so its useless to see what they might have on cask , or the current seasonal . <sssss> and that menu link ? <sssss> circa prior-to-the-name-change from sonoran brewhouse , so you ca n't rely on that .
?		yum , this place was great . <sssss> went with a party of 5 on this past first friday 's and only waiting about 10-15 minutes . <sssss> not too bad at all ! <sssss> services was excellent . <sssss> i loved their wine list . <sssss> we each ordered a different pizza , so i was able to try 5 different kinds . <sssss> i like the quattro cheese one the most . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> i will definitely return once i 've checked out some other pizza this town has to offer . <sssss> two thumbs up !
?		i 'm new to sushi and when we met up with a couple of friends on a tuesday night , i 'm glad i did . <sssss> i had the opportunity to try 5 or 6 different kinds and i liked them all . <sssss> when i go back i 'll be getting the golden state roll , it was delicious ! <sssss> ca n't wait to go again .
?		bev mo is a great place to pick up most of your alcohol needs . <sssss> why only three stars ? <sssss> with the idea of an inclusive liquor store , i had hoped it would be easy to find a few of my favorites . <sssss> i 've tried to find some guatemalan beer and some miller chill in cans and have so far been unsuccessful . <sssss> i have however looked up the miller chills on their website and they are there ! <sssss> none of the guatemalan . <sssss> . <sssss> i also looked for tripel karmeleit but not there . <sssss> aside from that , it has pretty much whatever you need . <sssss> there is an impressive selection of bottled soda . <sssss> i am looking forward to going back just for that reason . <sssss> and to brows through some wine and beer .
?		i really liked this one . <sssss> now , granted , i went to a night game , and it was really windy , so i had the entertainment of seeing tons of garbage and other stuff get whisped onto the field . <sssss> it was pretty funny ! <sssss> i sat in the bleachers close to the away team dugout -lrb- cubs ... were the away team : -rrb- -rrb- i had a good time . <sssss> i did n't like that the bathrooms were so seperated and i do remember not being too many stalls , so the wait was pretty horrible , but beside from that , a great stadium . <sssss> i love that you are close enough to some other fine establishments to enjoy some food and drink before the game , and still be able to walk to the park .
?		the absurdly delicious burgers here do well to reconcile the awkward , uncomfortable seating . <sssss> prior to actually masticating your foodstuffs though , the anticipation makes you all the more cognizant of the random strangers ' elbows bumping yours . <sssss> i have n't had much luck with delux drinks ; fortunately my mouth was so busy orgasming after sweet potato fries , i did n't have much time to ruminate over my shitty lemon drop martini . <sssss> after the fact of course , i decided that the drink tasted like a melted safeway-brand lemonade popsicle with a hint of rubbing alcohol . <sssss> i should have gone with any one of the awesome beers offered . <sssss> the service makes me feel slightly unwelcome and a bit in the way . <sssss> the central seating is a prime spot to get jostled by the clipped paces of busy servers . <sssss> sometimes they apologize ; other times , they 're probably so used to running over everything in their path , that they do n't even notice when they 've accosted you . <sssss> but god , those fucking burgers . <sssss> when all is said and done , the burgers make the bruises all better .
?		bookman 's is the ultimate sanctuary for add-addled adults with an uncanny ability to justify purchasing magazine back-issues in bulk . <sssss> no joke - this place caters to my easily-overwhelmed sensibilities and makes me feel like i need to own tattered joycean hardbacks just to lend my apartment the smell of ancient books . <sssss> it 's like park and swap jr. - there is pretty much the grandest selection of old junk , mixed with new junk , mixed with questionably-useless junk . <sssss> all of this proverbial junk , though , seems completely necessary . <sssss> the staff rules , and the credit there never expires so you can trade in your unwanted garbage for some in-store points and maybe buy yourself a gamecube or some elementary teach yourself japanese texts . <sssss> in any case , if you leave bookman 's without a claw full of relics , you have way too much self-control .
?		the existence of red hot robot really cuts down on my monthly vinyl-and-plush shipping costs . <sssss> it 's a huge bummer for me that phoenix does n't offer more specialty shops like this , but for what it is , it 's pretty amazing . <sssss> quaint , minimalist setup ; all the toys are easily accessible , the owner is amicable , and quietly regards you as you shop , ready to field questions without getting in your way . <sssss> not a huge selection , but i 've been spoiled by larger shops with a greater local following in ca . <sssss> you ca n't really knock rhr for not having as big a base out here - taking into account its location , this shop is pretty excellent . <sssss> it 's organized , well-maintained and does n't threaten to hyperventilate you like kid robot in sf .
?		we came here to celebrate my friend 's birthday . <sssss> personally we did n't try any of the food because we had eaten earlier . <sssss> the servers were nice , but my best friend 's husband complained that the drink he ordered was terrible -lrb- it was , we all took a sip ; it tasted like cough syrup -rrb- but the server did n't really didnt seem surprised or remove the drink until my friend 's husband gave it to her . <sssss> also through the process of serving all the sushi dishes they could n't remember who had which ones , and which was which ; there was a few minutes of confusion . <sssss> we 're not supposed to know which sushi is which , the servers are . <sssss> there also was some inconsistencies with the wasabi . <sssss> some were so mild you could barely taste anything , while the others were so spicy that it brought tears to your eyes . <sssss> no one made complaints on any of the sushi itself . <sssss> however based on what i saw , i know i 've had way better . <sssss> we also took a look at the menu , and their prices are outrageous . <sssss> i truly think ra is more of a trendy thing , like starbucks ... people just seem to go here because of the name . <sssss> we 'll just stick to our regular place for sushi .
?		we 've gone here quite a few times and every time its great ! <sssss> my boyfriend loves the beer and we always get burgers because they 're just that good . <sssss> prices are moderate ; roughly $ 11.00 per person for food , throw in a few more dollars for a beer . <sssss> it can be pretty loud on a weekend night but hey , its not only a bar , its brewery ! <sssss> atmosphere is fun and service is always friendly .
?		this morning we decided to give this place a try after reading the positive yelp reviews . <sssss> our experience was ... okay . <sssss> nothing horrible but nothing great either . <sssss> i got the traditional eggs benedict and my boyfriend got the irish eggs benedict . <sssss> it was good , a little lacking in flavor but okay . <sssss> the potatoes , however , were extremely bland and lacking of any seasoning . <sssss> i needed to add salt and pepper to my entire meal , which came from these dirty looking tin cans sitting on the table . <sssss> i noticed the portion of potatoes they gave us was extremely small , i felt gypped ! <sssss> i almost said something but decided not to make a fuss over it . <sssss> the waitress brought us a glass jar filled with ketchup for the potatoes ... i did n't like this at all . <sssss> the jar had some dried ketchup on the underneath side of the glass lid and it just looked greasy on the outside with finger prints all over it . <sssss> it just bothered me . <sssss> i know they 're trying to be cute and unique but really just leave it in the original ketchup bottle . <sssss> also this is n't a large eatery , with only about 10 tables . <sssss> the size does n't exactly bother me but when you have a baby at the next table screaming , the entire room gets tense , you can actually feel it . <sssss> but it 's not the size of the room its how they use the space . <sssss> the farm house in gilbert is also a very small space but it is extremely warm and inviting , mark 's cafe lacks this . <sssss> fyi , if you have n't tried the farmhouse off of gilbert just south of guadalupe , please do , it 's incredible , but get there before 8am or you 'll be waiting in a line that goes around the building ! <sssss> wonderful place ! <sssss> just a side note if the owners ever read their yelp reviews . <sssss> we noticed they were playing religious music , which did n't bother us even though we 're not religious , but for the sake of respecting everyone who comes into your place of business it would be a good idea to be neutral so you do n't lose customers . <sssss> all in all this place was mediocre at best . <sssss> i definitely felt it was over priced for what you get . <sssss> service was fast and friendly so that was a plus . <sssss> however , knowing that i can get better quality , better tasting food , with cheaper prices elsewhere has me thinking we may not be back . <sssss> we often go to crackers cafe on elliot and priest which is excellent . <sssss> we 've been there over a dozen times and every time it 's a win . <sssss> wonderful food , great environment , friendly staff , and prices that make you feel like you 're getting a great deal . <sssss> mark 's cafe is over priced with a lack of comfort in their decor and food .
?		we went here last night for the first time and really liked it ! <sssss> my boyfriend got the orange chicken , and i had the walnut shrimp . <sssss> both meals were very flavorful , cooked well , were great portions , and also reheated nicely the next day . <sssss> for some reason i really liked their fortune cookies too . <sssss> i know it sounds like an odd thing to mention but i did ! <sssss> i usually never eat them but their fortune cookies had a homemade taste to them ! <sssss> we will absolutely be going back !
?		ahhh-mazing !!! <sssss> i do n't want to make this a lengthy review so here 's just a few things . <sssss> the atmosphere was wonderful . <sssss> it was trendy with it 's wooden accents , lit candles , and stark white linens . <sssss> the service was outstanding . <sssss> could n't have asked for a more knowledgeable and sincere guy . <sssss> even when someone in our party ordered something that is normally sent back he let her know , and then gave her another option that would go with the tastes she was looking for . <sssss> he was wonderful at pairing the perfect wines with our food . <sssss> the food was out of this world . <sssss> we shared the chopped salad -lrb- which has it 's own facebook page , lol -rrb- . <sssss> it was hands down the best salad i 've ever eaten , and i 'm not a salad person . <sssss> we both ordered the filet mignon which came with some greens and smashed potatoes . <sssss> i 've have never had a more tender and juicy filet in my life . <sssss> it was absolutely fantastic ! <sssss> hats off to the chef ! <sssss> please know this place is quite pricey so be prepared for that . <sssss> our salad , two filets , and his two beers came to about $ 93 but it was so amazingly worth the splurge .
?		update !!! <sssss> lowering my review to 1 star , i 'd give zero stars if i could . <sssss> i explained in my first review how i purchased a gift certificate through my work 's discount program for employees and a newly changed policy is to no longer charge the 18 % gratuity . <sssss> however when i came to atl wings on friday they forced me to pay that gratuity . <sssss> my work contacted them about illegally charging me and atl wings actually gave push back ! <sssss> now keep in mind the company i work for is not some tiny little nothing business ; it 's the largest corporation in the world for it 's industry and atl wings is so arrogant they think this may not effect them . <sssss> let me tell you atl wings , in my building alone , i work with nearly 2000 people , who most of which reside in mesa , gilbert , and chandler ; word of mouth is a very powerful tool . <sssss> this restaurant is now being reported to www.restaurant.com to be taken off of the program for employees to purcahse gift certificates ! <sssss> clearly they have no respect for their customers . <sssss> they only want as many dollars as they can get , even if this means going against contracts they sign with other companies and ignoring policies that are given .
?		amazing food !! <sssss> is it me , or has this place gotten even better lately ?? <sssss> they even have a separate gluten free vegan menu , which is helpful . <sssss> looove the chili fries and the buffalo wings . <sssss> favorites include anything with their chicken in it ... the sweet and sour chicken is to die for . <sssss> love that this place is next to nami . <sssss> it 's perfect ... get our yums on here and then head to nami for dessert . <sssss> the brunch is very good here as well . <sssss> have i mentioned the buffalo wings ? <sssss> oh myyyyy .
?		about the only thing i can eat is the potatoes . <sssss> that said , i 've tried other there while `` cheating '' like their omelettes . <sssss> i am not impressed . <sssss> how can anyone be impressed with processed cheese and greasy gobs of hash browns ??? <sssss> ick . <sssss> next time , i 'm lobbying for waffle house . <sssss> plus , the last time i was there , i was recovering from surgery and in a wheelchair . <sssss> the person at the front taking names and seating people was downright rude . <sssss> yes , she was young and ignorant , but she still acted badly .
?		tasty black beans and veggie burritos . <sssss> good to-go vegetarian burritos ! <sssss> a rarity here in phx .
?		i think you can always tell the quality of a thai restaurant by how good their pad thai is ! <sssss> this place has yummy pad thai !!!!! <sssss> very friendly and very accommodating !
?		indian comfort food and grocery . <sssss> dinner -lrb- in the restaurant section of this building -rrb- is served traditionally with several other dishes to on your tray to balance the palate . <sssss> everything is made fresh right as you order it ... the vegetables chopped , the dishes spiced . <sssss> cheap price for so much food including dessert ! <sssss> soooo delicious !! <sssss> long vegetarian menu . <sssss> two tvs in the place play bollywood movies and videos . <sssss> funzies !
?		my favorite is the thai pizza sans chicken . <sssss> wow . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> anyone that puts bean sprouts on their pizza and can pull it off with flair and taste has to be given kudos ! <sssss> great veggie pizza by the slice ... there 's always one meat , one veg , and cheese ... perfect ! <sssss> cozy spot to have a beer and grab a slice . <sssss> plus , they usually have a special for two slices and a beer ... so even better !
?		location location location . <sssss> i almost felt like i was back in europe sitting outside at cheuvront ... right along central and watching the lightrail whiz by , people walking along the sidewalks and the overall hustle of ` city ' life . <sssss> the inside , however , lacked a certain intimacy that i like to see in wine bars . <sssss> it is quite casual and airy ... not cozy with low lighting like i was expecting/hoping for . <sssss> it was quite busy for an early evening -lrb- probably because their happy hour is great and otherwise its a bit pricey -rrb- . <sssss> the parking lot was full so i gambled with potentially being towed and parked along a side street a few blocks down . <sssss> the waiters were excellent at recommending different wines and letting us sample a few before deciding . <sssss> i settled on santa ema merlot , which was really fantastic ! <sssss> you could spend hours pouring over the varied cheeses and wines cheuvront offers -lrb- even have a special retail section inside devoted to cheese and wine -rrb- . <sssss> besides the great atmosphere outside , there are other wine bars that i would prefer to go to -lrb- 5th and wine , rokerij , bomberos -rrb- . <sssss> however , if you are in cenpho and looking for a good glass of wine it is definitely worth stopping by .
?		t cooks is my favorite happy hour in the area . <sssss> for reals . <sssss> i want to go there right now . <sssss> my boyfriend and i somewhat arrived on accident one night , only to realize that i have been missing the best happy hour ever ! <sssss> we have been back many times since , and i try to recommend it to all my girlfriends . <sssss> its part of the palm hotel , so obviously its beautiful , elegant , comfortable and more . <sssss> they have a lovely inside bar and live music sometimes too . <sssss> but my favorite spot to sit is the beautiful outside patio , especially now , as the weather here is amazing . <sssss> so they have super fancy smancy cocktail list , which is all 50 % off during happy hour . <sssss> they also have awesome discounted appetizers . <sssss> we had the pretzel bites with cheese and grilled brie . <sssss> but the best night to go is monday night for mustache monday . <sssss> they have even more discounted cocktails with names like `` the ron burgundy and fu-manchu '' . <sssss> also - fake mustaches . <sssss> so fun ! <sssss> connie is awesome , she is super cute and has been our server a few times now . <sssss> always spot on with recommendations and even comped us a few drinks when the service was slow . <sssss> little did she know that i love t cooks despite anything !
?		i do n't usually write 1 stars but moira does deserve this one . <sssss> my boyfriend and i went in last night for reverse happy hour , as i have wanted to check out moira for some time . <sssss> we walked in and immediately the hostess said ` be right back ' and left us awkwardly standing in the entrance for a good 5 minutes . <sssss> we were already thinking about leaving but were finally seated and each ordered a sultry saki from the cocktail menu . <sssss> after about 15 minutes without our drink , we were again seriously pondering just leaving . <sssss> i do understand when places are busy or short staffed . <sssss> this really did n't seem to be the case at all . <sssss> plenty of tables empty and a good amount of waitstaff in sight . <sssss> finally our drink came and it was the weakest , worst , watery drink i have ever had . <sssss> when the ice melted in the drink , it still tasted the same . <sssss> huge waste of $ 6 . <sssss> the worst part of the evening came at the end when i got our bill . <sssss> i noticed that our waiter overcharged us for the fried tofu , which is under the $ 3 menu column . <sssss> *** keep in mind that the happy hour menu is all black with white text . <sssss> however , the waiter was refusing to honor the $ 3 price because apparently in black pen on the black menu was a handwritten in $ 5 sign , that you could only see if you held your phone light over the menu . <sssss> i actually laughed and told him this is ridiculous and is n't going to happen . <sssss> finally he obliged and took of the $ 2 overcharge . <sssss> long story short , terrible drinks , terrible service and watch out of invisible amendments to the menu pricing .
?		i love dive bars and unlike many other dive bars , monkey pants is one with a younger crowd ... one where you will not be the only person without an aarp card in your wallet . <sssss> the bartender looked like the main male character from -lrb- 500 -rrb- days of summer . <sssss> great . <sssss> the drinks were cheap and strong . <sssss> even greater . <sssss> this is probably the reason that i even thought the bartender looked like a quasi joseph gordon-levitt . <sssss> hands down , the best part of the night is when its time for ` free shots if you take off your shirt ' . <sssss> ideally this is meant for the ladies of the bar . <sssss> the reality , however , is much more entertaining . <sssss> suddenly there are dozens of shirtless men -lrb- who really should n't be shirtless in any circumstance -rrb- parading around the bar . <sssss> anyone first walking into the establishment would think they 've entered a bad porno or some sort of explicit party . <sssss> its hilarious but unfortunately that image will be forever burned into my memory , regardless of how much alcohol was circulating throughout my nueral cavity . <sssss> i had to hold back one star only because the crowd is a bit to ` frat boy ' esque for my liking . <sssss> although it is par for the course being located on mill ave near asu campus .
?		i can not believe i have n't reviewed coach house yet . <sssss> this is truly my favorite bar and always my ` go-to ' spot . <sssss> great location in old town but without the typical scottsdale crowd . <sssss> lots of parking . <sssss> great bartenders . <sssss> cheap and strong drinks -lrb- best combination -rrb- . <sssss> moderately sanitary bathrooms . <sssss> crazy christmas lights and decorations . <sssss> if you are lucky enough to go around the holiday season ... it is literally like santa threw up all over coach house . <sssss> lights , wrapping paper , ornaments , candy canes , shitty christmas decorations up the ying yang . <sssss> its wonderful . <sssss> i would not want to be the guy having to put up/take down all that each year . <sssss> every single time i go to coach house , it is an awesome time . <sssss> always meet interesting people and have actually made a few friends from my encounters there . <sssss> the inside is fairly small with rickety tables but a great jukebox and arcade games . <sssss> large outdoor area to meander as well . <sssss> * best bar in old town *
?		one of the best restaurants i 've had the luxury of dining at in decades . <sssss> i could n't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue . <sssss> the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic . <sssss> the signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you dainfully sip your way into alcoholic bliss . <sssss> the oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a ` honey i shrunk the kids ' situation . <sssss> the cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure . <sssss> they soothe the restless ` fat kid ' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving cheslea 's kitchen a bit more bareable .
?		i 've been coming to good old da vang for 10 + years now . <sssss> i first stumbled upon this eatery when my high school friends -lsb- crap , did i just age myself ? <sssss> -rsb- took me here for lunch . <sssss> it was love at first bite ~ the food is cheap , plentiful , and extremely tasty . <sssss> while the parking lot is n't in the best shape and the restaurant itself is as alluring as a dumpy gas station , come for the food ! <sssss> just make sure you do n't need to use the restroom ... ick ! <sssss> service here is decent . <sssss> they always try to speak vietnamese to me even though i 'm not viet . <sssss> anyways , give this little hole-on-the-wall a try ! <sssss> the food definitely makes up for the lack of ambiance .
?		by far the best place for some chicken and waffles with a nice tall mason jar full of red kool-aid ! <sssss> while some may say the location is n't the best -lsb- okay , it can seem pretty sketchy after dusk -rsb- , the food is amazing ! <sssss> i usually get the betty boop -lsb- a waffle and a breast -rsb- and some mac & cheese if i 'm feeling extra hungry . <sssss> the waffle is always crisp and delicious and the fried chicken is delicious . <sssss> got ta love that savory-sweet combo of a syrup-y bite of waffle with a juicy bite of chicken . <sssss> * shivers * the service is always friendly and this place is usually packed . <sssss> lo-lo 's definitely lives up to all their hype -lsb- do n't go to the scottsdale location though . <sssss> totes not the same . <sssss> -rsb- ~ !
?		boston 's is kind of on the same level as applebee 's for me . <sssss> although boston 's food is a million times better , the atmosphere is kind of bland . <sssss> as for food , as i 've said , it 's pretty good but the portions are kinda small . <sssss> the pizza is okay . <sssss> i 'd rather go to nypd pizza . <sssss> at least the nachos are fine . <sssss> a plus about this place : happy hour is a steal . <sssss> cheap drinks , cheap food ... definitely worth trying !
?		when china king opened a few years back , the food was absolutely delicious ! <sssss> everything came piping hot , service was pro , and the food was always fresh . <sssss> these days , it seems like no matter what time you stop in , the food is always just reheated and never made to order . <sssss> i 've been to china king for dim sum and dinner and the food seems pretty inconsistent . <sssss> i think the previous chef must 've left because the food is pretty sub-par . <sssss> their prices are ridiculous for the quality you 're getting and service has steadily dwindled to the point where the waitress will burn you with the tea pot if you do n't move away fast enough -- never an apology , oh well ! <sssss> i just hate getting a steamer of dried siu mai and soggy shrimp dumplings . <sssss> nothing makes me more mad . <sssss> the overall decor is still decently clean and new but the ambiance is a bit bland ! <sssss> i say skip china king and head to a better eatery .
?		i first came to sushi 101 as a wide-eyed freshmen at asu back in the fall of 2003 -lsb- shh , i 'm still 21 , okay !? <sssss> -rsb- and have been back plenty of times since . <sssss> this is pretty much a staple place for all asu students to go to since it 's right across the street from campus . <sssss> anyways , on with the review ! <sssss> the decor and ambiance of the place is pretty chill . <sssss> the place is always busy and service is usually speedy . <sssss> try the stuffed jalapenos ; wash it down with lots of eel and salmon ; get some different bites of tuna in between ; order the obligatory asu and sun devil rolls ; never ever forget the soft shell crab ; and once you 've discreetly unbuttoned the top button of your skinny jeans and kicked your feet up into your friend 's lap , splurge and get some tempura ice cream because let 's face it : there 's always room for fried dessert . <sssss> while the quality is n't exactly the best and i would n't drive out of my way to stop in for a bite , i 'll always have a soft spot for sushi 101 and all the warm fuzzy -lsb- and drunken -rsb- memories attached to the place . <sssss> also , they have a great happy hour menu worth checking out and their lunch specials are decent .
?		i really love everything about this spot . <sssss> if i lived in scottsdale , i would be here everyday for happy hour . <sssss> the atmosphere is wonderful , like a generous patio at someone 's home . <sssss> it feels tucked away , although you are really off a pretty busy street . <sssss> there is also plenty of room inside when the heat is too much . <sssss> the service is attentive and the food is fresh and vibrant . <sssss> this is also a great place to just get drinks ...
?		do n't go here if you are trying to eat healthy ... too many temptations at every turn . <sssss> i had amazing scallops for dinner , but only after eating a ridiculous amount of bread . <sssss> the hamburgers in the bar looked and smelled incredible . <sssss> i like the spicy spin they put on most of the dishes ... mac and cheese is killer .
?		the tour was great and informative . <sssss> i loved imagining what life must have been like with so much creativity flowing . <sssss> my only issue is having to take the tour with a bunch of half wits who ca n't listen and are bent on doing the very things the facility has asked them not to do . <sssss> what the hell is wrong with people ?
?		cool spot to stop for a drink if you 're in the neighborhood . <sssss> this is definitely a place for cocktails , as opposed to other libations . <sssss> signature cocktails are the way to go -- i had a cucumber-mint martini , which was very good . <sssss> the ambiance is modern and slightly euro , and also very urban . <sssss> the absence of windows , dim lighting and backdoor entrance make sidebar feel exclusive . <sssss> there is no outdoor space , so this place might be a great option for hiding out on a hot summer night .
?		mondays and tuesdays at radio milano are `` neighborhood nights , '' meaning you can get a salad and an entree , or a dessert and an entree for $ 20 . <sssss> last night was my second experience at rm . <sssss> not only was the food superb , but i ca n't think of a single other place in this region or elsewhere where you can get a chopped salad and filet mignon for $ 20 . <sssss> everything was top-quality , including the service . <sssss> great food , great wine , cool ambiance -- perhaps my new favorite neighborhood restaurant .
?		one of the best new restaurants i 've been to in a while . <sssss> a converted 1940s-ish scottsdale home , this place has the best ambiance -- especially the outdoor patio . <sssss> the brisket appetizer is amazing . <sssss> i had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic . <sssss> ca n't wait to return !
?		i go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company . <sssss> i usually sit at the bar . <sssss> the seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them . <sssss> the cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade . <sssss> the food is good and cheap . <sssss> the bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that `` one '' who wo n't pay attention to you at all . <sssss> i think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone . <sssss> the parking is n't that great .
?		every time i go there it seems to be about the same great atmosphere . <sssss> excellent service , cheerful wait staff , clean restrooms , tables and the selection in live music is awesome . <sssss> i always recommend any of my friends to this place when we want to hang out , have a few drinks , eat or watch the bands . <sssss> only thing i would say is not that great is the parking . <sssss> it 's extremely tight and your car will get dinged .
?		all i wanted was a freaking awesome tasting burger and that is what i got ! <sssss> i also ordered the homemade potato chips and did not want to share it with anybody . <sssss> they tasted so good . <sssss> the service was awesome . <sssss> love the free peanuts and bread while you wait for your meal . <sssss> what a clever idea .
?		this place is pretty nice to visit for entertainment . <sssss> the seats are high and the arm rest retract . <sssss> there is plenty of leg room and low lighting so if you need to take a restroom break you can see the steps . <sssss> but this is where this place goes wrong . <sssss> only one centralized restroom so if your movie is in the back corner there is quite a walk . <sssss> the restroom needs better ventilation and constant upkeep during busy hours .
?		cute little shop ! <sssss> we ordered a bunch of cake pops for an office birthday party and they were a huge hit ! <sssss> thanks for making our celebration extra special . <sssss> i am looking forward to coming back and trying the cupcakes and other goodies .
?		we went there on a friday night with my whole family to celebrate my birthday . <sssss> no one in our group had ever been there before , so it was a treat to try out a new place ... but , also , sort of a gamble , because we were n't sure what to expect and we have quite a few picky eaters in the bunch . <sssss> to my surprise and pleasure , everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal ! <sssss> i got the luau pork sandwich , which the menu claims to be `` heaven on a bun '' and they were not lying ! <sssss> it was so delicious . <sssss> the boyfriend got the bali hai bbq ribs and the meat was literally falling off the bone . <sssss> it was perfectly cooked . <sssss> his only complaint was that the sweet potato fries were too sweet and did n't go with the ribs . <sssss> i think he would have preferred the wasabi mashed potatoes instead . <sssss> i wanted to order one of everything off the drink menu , because i could n't make up my mind . <sssss> everything sounded good ! <sssss> our waiter was so attentive . <sssss> he very discretely circled around his tables every few minutes or so to make sure everyone was taken care of , but he did n't interrupt the meal , unless , of course , you flagged him down for something . <sssss> it was a really great experience and i ca n't wait to go back there again !
?		service is often pretty crappy , but their food is good . <sssss> the gollo burro is one of their specialties , getting it `` green style '' is key . <sssss> my family and i ordered take out from there a couple weeks ago and they definitely skimped on the portions . <sssss> my bean burrito barely had anything to it and my side of rice was only a couple bites . <sssss> kind of frustrating . <sssss> usually bad service can be easily forgotten by good food and decent prices , but i think i will keep my trips to casa r to a minimum .
?		the food was fabulous . <sssss> the service and atmosphere were wonderful . <sssss> on a beautiful day like today , it was the perfect setting to sit out on the patio . <sssss> it is worth saving room for dessert . <sssss> i took half of my lunch home so that i could enjoy dessert . <sssss> yum !
?		i took my mom out to the olive mill for a visit when she visited from montana . <sssss> we really enjoyed our time . <sssss> we took the tour , had lunch and took some goodies home . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure that i ca n't live without their garlic flavored olive oil from now on . <sssss> it is so fresh and yummy . <sssss> i 'll definitely be going back or ordering online . <sssss> my visit felt reminiscent of my visits to wineries in sonoma/napa . <sssss> it was neat to have that feeling in arizona . <sssss> i love supporting local businesses just like this one .
?		the morning glory cafe is excellent . <sssss> my boyfriend took me here for the first time to meet some of his family , and i just fell in love . <sssss> i like the atmosphere and the food is hearty . <sssss> i scheduled a morning brunch with all of my girlfriends there a few weeks ago and it went off without a hitch . <sssss> the staff is great !
?		i love this place . <sssss> it has the perfect lunch portions , atmosphere and menu . <sssss> i think it would be hard to find a better place for lunch . <sssss> yum !
?		the setting reminds me of an upscale diner and every time i have been in it has been packed . <sssss> i usually opt to sit at the bar because the service is much faster . <sssss> last time i came in i had the veggie omelet , and while drowning in cheese it was still pretty good . <sssss> the accompanying toast was pre-buttered -lrb- i hate that -rrb- and the potatoes lacked flavor . <sssss> all in all this place is a pretty solid breakfast spot , if you are not expecting more than your average diner food .
?		i frequent this valle luna often because my grandmother loves it . <sssss> it has been one of her favorite restaurants for over 3 decades and what grammie wants grammie gets . <sssss> the gradual decline in the customer service has become painfully obvious over the years . <sssss> the food usually arrives in different intervals , and often before we get our silverware . <sssss> the tables are so close together you have to practically scream to hear your dining partners . <sssss> the salsa is flavorful yet has no spice , and the last cheese crisps we ordered were soggy and undercooked . <sssss> the silverware is disgusting , they 've obviously been using it for over 30 years . <sssss> we went last night and observed one of the most incompetent and rude hosts in history . <sssss> he was a smart ass teenage blond boy that kept pronouncing peoples names wrong . <sssss> i watched as he past over two separate groups due to the mispronunciations -lrb- can he not read his own writing ? <sssss> -rrb- i could n't take it anymore and hipped them to the situation , he responded with indignant rudeness instead of apologies . <sssss> luckily for him the group was half tanked from sitting in the bar so they waited to be seated before complaining . <sssss> now all this aside . <sssss> valle luna makes the best grilled pork chimichanga i have ever tasted . <sssss> hands down . <sssss> order it , gain 5 pounds , thank me later . <sssss> 5 star chimi , 1 star service , = 3 star review .
?		holy canolli this place is fantastic ! <sssss> how have i never been here before ? <sssss> the set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes , frank sinatra , harry james and tommy dorsey . <sssss> it really reminded me of artie bucco 's sister restaurant . <sssss> the service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable . <sssss> we even heard the owner/chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen `` wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar ! '' <sssss> it was classic . <sssss> he really showed a passion for both the guests and the food . <sssss> i had read a few yelp reviews before i chose this place and i can only mirror what everyone else said . <sssss> the italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing . <sssss> the spaghetti and meatballs were to die for . <sssss> the meatballs literally melt in your mouth . <sssss> i want to go back and try everything on the menu . <sssss> spoiler alert - after the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99 , you get the number and dinner is free . <sssss> we did n't win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal . <sssss> i will be back - i am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back !
?		switch is a standard three stars . <sssss> i love love love fez and do n't want to diss the sista ... but the food here is pretty bland . <sssss> they could definitely update their menu , at first it seems decent , then you realize the items are the same , just prepared in different ways . <sssss> . <sssss> each time i have been here the staff has been inattentive at best . <sssss> the hummus did not even come close to the deliciousness fez serves up . <sssss> the french dip was just ok -lrb- and came out cold -rrb- . <sssss> the gallette i tried was like a turkey pot pie , decent but nothing to rave about . <sssss> maybe it is not fair to compare to fez , maybe i had too high of expectations ... they do serve delicious sangria , and they have a great happy hour 2-4-1 caipirinhas and sangria -lrb- so rare to have sangria on happy hour these days -rrb- . <sssss> i will give switch another chance , maybe i just came on a few off nights . <sssss> .
?		why did i love this place so much ? <sssss> + free softserve icecream + loads of organic produce and bread + no high fructose corn syrup -lrb- unless you get a soda -rrb- + excellent spicey tortilla soup + quick , healthy and delicious + my bf got the potatoe and i could n't believe the monster ! <sssss> it was 4 lbs ! <sssss> it sounds like this place has improved since earlier reviews . <sssss> i would go back anytime for lunch , it was great . <sssss> and kids eat free on sunday 's -lrb- so avoid it like the plauge and go another day ; -rrb-
?		i had lunch here again the other day and i realize i was either very high or absolutely starving last time i ate here . <sssss> this visit i pretty much had the opposite experience . <sssss> the food was horrible . <sssss> the salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist , the burrito was dry and bland . <sssss> they sat us in a room under a tv and it was so loud we could barely talk . <sssss> i 'll have to go back though ... at least give them one more shot . <sssss> .
?		tasteful atmosphere with a great patio , a cozy bar area with stylish mood lighting , a sleek dining room outfitted with red leather chairs , leafy potted plants , and mirrors along the saffron-colored walls . <sssss> they have a good variety of dishes to choose from , all prepared with fresh ingredients and all perfectly cooked and attractively presented . <sssss> i had the guacammus and calamari and both were excellent , but the seafood fresca really stole the show . <sssss> . <sssss> the tilapia was light and flaky and the lime sauce on top was so good my mouth is watering just thinking of it ! <sssss> they also have an excellent happy hour with half priced entrees and good drink specials . <sssss> the only drawback ? <sssss> the sangria , i will admit i am a sangria snob but this was so sweet it was barely drinkable . <sssss> they should really pop over to lola 's tappas and try and duplicate their recipe ! <sssss> all in all great place highly recommended .
?		best damn zucchini fries i have ever had , sprinkled with parmesan and served with a home made ranch . <sssss> they are in no way healthy and in every way delicious . <sssss> these things will blow your mind . <sssss> my favorite is the samburger $ 10 , applewood smoked bacon , substitute pepperjack cheese . <sssss> i really love this place and it is in my regular rotation .
